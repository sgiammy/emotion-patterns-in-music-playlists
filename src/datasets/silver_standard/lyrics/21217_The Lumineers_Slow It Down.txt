I feel her filth in my bones
Wash off my hands till it's gone
The walls they're closing in
With velvet curtains

Some love was made for the light
Some kiss your cheek and goodnight
Lift up a red high heel
Lock up your doors with steel

They're makin' noise in my street
My blinds are drawn I can't see
Smashed in my car window
Didn't touch the stereo

Slow it down, Angie come back to bed
Rest your arms, and rest your legs

Act like you've been here before
Smile less and dress up some more
Tie up your scarf real tight
These boys are out for blood tonight

Slow it down, Angie come back to bed
Rest your arms, and rest your legs

And when she stood she stood tall
She'll make a fool of you all
Don't ask for cigarettes
She ain't got nothin' left for you

I never, she never, we never looked back
That wasn't what we were good at
And when it came to love
We were not good enough

Slow it down, Angie come back to bed
Rest your arms, and rest your legs
Don't you frown when you're feelin' like that
Only love can dig you out of this
