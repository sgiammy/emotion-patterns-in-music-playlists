Set me off like dynamite strapped tight around my waist
We are the ones in competition but claim this ain't no race

(Let's go!)

Take a breath and explode like bullets
Tearing through the wind
Cut me up with a razor blade
Then try to separate the skin

Now in the
White flames of burning flags
We found a world worth dying for, yeah
We've been battered so hard that
We don't feel anymore

Take me
From this world
Save me
What if we all
Die young?
So take me
From this world
Save me
What if we all
Die young?

Send me off on the morning breeze so far away from here
Fill your eyes in the strains of thought outside the warm embracing air
I'm moving slow
Like a glacier melting
Watch me dissipate
I searched for love in an empty world
But all I found was hate

Now in the
White flames of burning flags
We found a world worth dying for, yeah
We've been battered so hard that
We don't feel anymore

Take me
From this world
Save me
What if we all
Die young?
So take me
From this world
Save me
What if we all
Die young?

Don't ask me why
'Cuz I don't know
Don't ask me how
I'm gonna solve this on my own
Don't ask me why
'Cuz I don't know
These things I'll never face
Scratch out the warning race
The wreckage of a job well done
I saw a place I'd never seen before, yeah
And that morning I refused to close my eyes anymore

So Take me
From this world
Save me
What if we all
Die young?
So take me
From this world
Save me
What if we all
Die young?

So take me
So take me
