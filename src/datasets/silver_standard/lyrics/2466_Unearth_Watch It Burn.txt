No longer on your side
No longer within your prison
No longer here to speak
With a positive spin on society

So sick of your politics
So sick of your fading religions
So sick of the endless lies
That ignite and divide, it's homicide

This is the reason
Your walls are coming down

Did you even hear a word I said?
Torch it all, torch it all
Did you even hear a word I said?
Watch it burn

The writing's on the wall
Watch it burn

So tired of your ignorance
So tired of your passing trends
So tired of your predictive script
You're all dead inside

So tired of your predictive script
You're all dead inside

It was supposed to be better than this
Can you imagine why?
The path of no return
Has killed all reason to believe

A paradox in the vow you've taken
Engulfed in your own world
The tried and true are now unspoken
God save you all

Did you even hear a word I said?
Torch it all, torch it all
Did you even hear a word I said?
Watch it burn

The writing's on the wall
The writing's on the wall
Watch it burn

Can you imagine why?
The writing's on the wall
We're all paralyzed
Ours has died

Paralyzed, hope has died
Paralyzed, our hope has died
Our hope has died, our hope has died
Our hope has died, our hope has died
Our hope is dead

Burn your eyes on our setting sun
Burn out your eyes
