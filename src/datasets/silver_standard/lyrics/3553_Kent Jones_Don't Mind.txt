She said "Pardon my French", I said "Bonjour Madame"
Then she said "Sak pase" and I said "N'ap boule"

She said "Hola, ¿Cómo estás?, she said "Konnichiwa"

She from Africa but she fucks me like she Haitian

Then I met a girl in Cali I never disowned her;
She got that high grade
Her weed come with diplomas, I want her
But she keep
