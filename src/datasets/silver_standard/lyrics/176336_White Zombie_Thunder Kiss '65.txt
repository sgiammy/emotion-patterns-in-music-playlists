Well, sweet little sista's
High as hell, cheating on a halo
Grind in an odyssey, a holocaust
A heart kicking on tomorrow

And a breakdown agony
I said an extacy in overdrive
We're riding on the world
Thunder kissin' nineteen-sixty

Five
Yeah, wow

Five
Yeah, wow
The demon warp is
Coming alive
In nineteen-sixty
Five, five, five

Livin' fast and dying young
A like an endless poetry
My motorcycle nightmare
Freak out inside of me

My soul salvation
Liberation, on the drive
The power of the blaster
Move me faster
Nineteen-sixty

Five
Yeah, wow

Five
Yeah, wow
The demon warp is
Coming alive
In nineteen-sixty
Five, five, five

"You're all shook up, aren't you baby?
I never try anything. I just do it.
Wanna try me?"

Rollin' like a supersonic
Another fool to get down on it
Pig sweat a million miles
I've got a heart atomic style
Make it look easy
That's what I said
A blast of silence explodes in my head

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

Give it back
Give it back, now

Give it back
Give it back, now

Give it back
Give it back, now

Give it back
Give it back

Step to the moonshine
Feeds the hell, the resurrection
What's new pussy-cat
Can you dig the satisfaction

Well you can't take it with you
But you can in overdrive
Yeah, some like it hot
Yeah, twisted, nineteen-sixty

Five
Yeah, wow

Five
Yeah, wow
The demon warp is
Coming alive
In nineteen-sixty
Five, five, five
