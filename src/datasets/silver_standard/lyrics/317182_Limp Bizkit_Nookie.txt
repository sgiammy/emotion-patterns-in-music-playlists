I came into this world as a reject
Look into these eyes
Then you'll see the size
Of the flames

Dwellin on my past
It's burnin on my brain
Everyone that burns
Has to learn from the pain

Hey, I think about the day
My girlie ran away with my pay
When fellas came to play
Now she's stuck
With my homies that she fucked
And I'm just a sucker
With a lump in my throat, hey

Like a chump
Hey
Like a chump
Hey

Like a chump
Hey
Like a chump
Hey

Like a chump
Hey
Like a chump
Hey

Like a chump
Hey

Should I be feelin' bad
Should I be feelin' good
It's kinda sad I'm the laughing
Stock of the neighborhood
And you would think that
I'd be movin' on

But I'm a sucker like I said
Fucked up in the head, not
And maybe she just made a mistake
And I should give her a break
But my heart will ache either way

Hey, what the hell
What you want me to say
I won't lie
That I can't deny

I did it all for the nookie
C'mon
The nookie

So you can take that cookie

And stick it up your

Why did it take so long
Why, did I wait so long, huh
To figure it out, but I did it
And I'm the only one
Underneath the sun
Who didn't get it

I can't believe
That I could be deceived
Not by my so-called girl
But in reality
She had a hidden agenda
She put my tender
Heart in a blender
And still I surrendered, hey

I'm only human
It's so easy for your friends
To give you their advice
They'll tell you, just let it go

It's easier said than done
I appreciate it, I do, but
Just leave me alone
Leave me alone
Just leave me alone

And nothing gonna change
You can go away
I'm just gonna stay here
And always be the same

And nothing gonna change
'Cause you can go away
And I'm just gonna stay here
And always be the same

And nothing gonna change
'Cause you can go away
I'm just gonna stay here
And always be the same
