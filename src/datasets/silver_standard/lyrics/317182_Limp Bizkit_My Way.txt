(Special) 
You think you're special, you do, I can see it in your eyes 
I can see it when you laugh at me, look down on me, and walk around on me 
Just one more fight about your leadership, and I will straight up leave your shit 
'Cause I've had enough of this, and now I'm pissed 

Yeah, this time I'mma let it all come out 
This time I'mma stand up and shout, "I'mma do things my way, it's my way, my way or the highway" 
This time I'mma let it all come out 
This time I'mma stand up and shout, "I'mma do things my way, it's my way, my way or the highway" 

Just one more fight about a lot of things, and I will give up everything 
To be on my own again, free again 

Yeah, this time I'mma let it all come out 
This time I'mma stand up and shout, "I'mma do things my way, it's my way, my way or the highway" 
This time I'mma let it all come out 
This time I'mma stand up and shout, "I'mma do things my way, it's my way, my way or the highway"

Someday, you'll see things my way 
'Cause you never know, no, you never know when you're gonna go 
Someday, you'll see things my way 
'Cause you never know, no, you never know when you're gonna go 

Just one more fight, and I'll be history 
Yes, I will straight up leave your shit 
And you'll be the one who's left missing me 

Yeah, this time I'mma let it all come out 
This time I'mma stand up and shout, "I'mma do things my way, it's my way, my way or the highway" 
This time I'mma let it all come out 
This time I'mma stand up and shout, "I'mma do things my way, it's my way, my way or the highway"
This time I'mma let it all come out 
This time I'mma stand up and shout, "I'mma do things my way, it's my way, my way or the highway" 
This time I'mma let it all come out 
This time I'mma stand up and shout, "I'mma do things my way, it's my way, my way or the highway"

Someday, you'll see things my way 
'Cause you never know, no, you never know when you're gonna go 
Someday, you'll see things my way 
'Cause you never know, no, you never know
