And she gon' shake it, like a red nose
Li-li-li-li-like a red nose
And she gon' shake it, like a red nose
Like a, like a, like a red nose
Like a, like a, like a red nose

That booty talkin' to me, what that shit say?
Shake it for the dojo I'm the sensei
Once you wobble, got my song on replay
Almost got'er at house, up off Kingsway
I told her shake it like a red nose pitbull
And I'mma keep throwin' money till your bank full
Cake-cake-cake-cake birthday suit
Damn in a little I'mma forget your age soon
Whoa, ok, now let's do it my way
If she don't go crazy then she walkin' on the highway
And if she don't believe me tell that bitch just try me
Bet you she be shakin' from the club back to my place whoa

And she gon' shake it, like a red nose
Li-li-li-li-like a red nose
And she gon' shake it, like a red nose
Like a, like a, like a red nose
Like a, like a, like a red nose

I told her time to go to work, clock in
Go on open up, I'm a locksmith
West side tell them other people stop it
I'm fly, and that's why she headed to the cockpit
Black Money Sage, whoadie I'mma winner
I just play'em like a game I don't press enter
I'm hella raw listen to the way I did'er
I was in'er and her nigga was there makin' dinner
Uh, all this money start movin' and I'mma throw it
She choosin' I got her lookin', hm is it ok?
Black Money we take'em in and then quit it
We shake'em and if she like me it's nothin', ok
Part hard party hard wit' no party fouls
Couple girls in the back wit' some potty mouths
Caver her back in, then turn the party out
Shake it like a red nose, time to let'em out, whoa

And she gon' shake it, like a red nose
Li-li-li-li-like a red nose
And she gon' shake it, like a red nose
Like a, like a, like a red nose
Like a, like a, like a red nose

All this money on me
All she tryna do is get naked, naked, naked, naked
Like a red nose
Li-li-li-li-like a red nose
Like a red nose
Like a, like a, like a red nose
Like a red nose
Li-li-li-li-like a red nose
Like a red nose
Like a, like a, like a red nose 2 trill
