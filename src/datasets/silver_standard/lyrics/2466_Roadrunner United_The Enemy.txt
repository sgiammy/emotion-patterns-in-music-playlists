I finally found myself
I tried to erase all this hate from my body
I tried to end all the lies all the pain that I caused everyone
But it all seemed so fucking useless

I can't forgive
And I can't forget
Don't you know who the fuck I am
I'm the enemy

I've lived a life of regret
I've had this burden of guilt suffocating
It's time to shed this disguise
And it's time to rise and destroy
Everyone in my fucking path 

I can't forgive
And I can't forget 
Don't you know who the fuck I am
I'm the enemy

Take a good look at me
I'm your enemy

Don't try to make amends
There's just no need
To pretend It will all be OK
You can try to run
And you can try to hide
But it's all fucking pointless

I can't forgive
And I can't forget
Don't you know who the fuck I am
I'm the enemy
The enemy
