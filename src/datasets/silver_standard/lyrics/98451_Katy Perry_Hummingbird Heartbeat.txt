You make me feel like I'm losing my virginity
The first time every time when you're touching me
I'll make you bloom like a flower that you never seen
Under the sun we are one bosomed energy

Let's pollinate to create a family tree
This evolution with you comes naturally
Some call it science, we call it chemistry
This is the story of the birds and the bees
And even when seasons change
Our love still stays the same

You give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat

I've flown a million miles just to find the magic seed
Oh, what a flower with the power to bring life to me
You're so exotic, my whole body fluttering
Constantly craving for a taste of your sticky sweet

Always on the brink of a heart attack
You give me life and keep me coming back
I see the sunrise in your eyes, your eyes
We've got a future full of blue skies, blue skies
Even when seasons change
Our love still stays the same

You give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat

You love me, you love me
Never love me not, not
I know when we were in perfect harmony
You make me sound like
Like a symphony

Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat

Spread my wings and make me fly
The taste of your honey is so sweet
When you give me that hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat

Hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
Hummingbird heartbeat
