I feel unique, not yet complete
And your steaming ice
Follow me, poor me, poor you, poor us
A fuss, a fight so I sat outside, outside

I am not your savior
I am not your savior, baby girl
I am not your savior
I am not your savior

What to do for when we meet
I'm incomplete and your freezing eyes
Wow me, poor me, poor you, poor us
What's wrong with a little task?
I am just a boy, I am so lonely

I am not your savior
I am not your savior, baby girl
I am not your savior
I am not your savior

I am not your savior
I am not your savior, baby girl
I am not your savior
I am not your savior

I am not your savior, oh no
Honey, I am not your savior, oh no
I am not your savior, baby girl
I am not your savior

Hurry, hurry, hurry
Hurry, hurry, hurry
I am not your savior, oh no
I am not your savior, baby girl

Ah oh, hurry
I am not your savior, oh no
I am not your savior, baby girl
I am not your savior

Hurry, hurry, hurry
Hurry, hurry, hurry
I am not your savior
