Everybody in the club in the heat
Pussy get to poppin' when we holdin' the beat
Bitches throwin' up, they posin' hands
Ass keep poppin' out these female pants

Every motherfucker sippin' on liquor
See the crunker they be gettin' when they be drinkin' a beer
And they be pullin' on a momma like, "Bitch come here"
Pullin' on a momma like, "Bitch come here"

I'm Santa Claus, didn't you hear?
Tell Johnny Saint Dick what you want this year
And we might get it to yo' ass by the summer
Who? Peter Pancakin' with a thumper

You, know we crank the club
Black magic in here, so drank it up
And you gon' be just as drunk as us
You gon' be just as drunk as us

Fin' to take it to the stage, drop
Put it all in yo' face, drop
Make it flow in the place, drop
'Fore a little buddy gotta bank, drop just to see you

Drop that motherfucker, drop that motherfucker
Drop that motherfucker, drop that motherfucker
Drop that motherfucker, drop that motherfucker
Drop that motherfucker, drop that motherfucker

Now let me put you up on somethin' different
All female need to pay attention
I wanna see you gyrate on the flo'
Move your body, body like you want this dough

This one right here for the sexy girl
With a two piece on go on work it girl
She'll make you keep comin', spendin' yo' money
When yo' mind need to be on yo' woman

But the way she move you hypnotized
Now you got pussy all in your eyes
Aye, bartender bring another round
Tips shorty on the pole, start slidin' down

Fuck it, might as well make it rain
'Cause pussy all around you callin' yo' name
They know what they got and they know how to use it
Drop that motherfucker to the music

Fin' to take it to the stage, drop
Put it all in yo' face, drop
Make it flow in the place, drop
'Fore a little buddy gotta bank, drop just to see you

Drop that motherfucker, drop that motherfucker
Drop that motherfucker, drop that motherfucker
Drop that motherfucker, drop that motherfucker
Drop that motherfucker, drop that motherfucker

When you see her on the flo'
You know she droppin' to the music
Yup, yup, we like that
Yup, yup, yup, yup, we like that

Put it all in yo' face
And still be droppin' to the music
Yup, yup, we like that
Yup, yup, yup, yup, we like that

Drop that motherfucker, drop
Drop that motherfucker, drop

Breakin' it down and makin' your rounds
On my house, see you the baddest bitch in the town
Layin' it down, they like the way she screw up the ground
Screw up the ground

Round and around she went representin' for the rent and the presidents
Hella thick, quick like some instant grits
Boy that's it, hot out the motherfuckin' oven
Buzzin', plus she doin' the shit that you lovin'

Fin' to take it to the stage, drop
Put it all in the face, drop
Make it flow in the place, drop
'Fore a little buddy gotta bank, drop just to see you

Drop that motherfucker, drop that motherfucker
Drop that motherfucker, drop that motherfucker
Drop that motherfucker, drop that motherfucker
Drop that motherfucker, drop that motherfucker

Drop, drop, drop, drop
Drop, drop, drop, drop
