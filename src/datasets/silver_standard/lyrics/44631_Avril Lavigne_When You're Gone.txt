I always needed time on my own
I never thought I'd
Need you there when I cry

And the days feel like years when I'm alone
And the bed where you lie
Is made up on your side

When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?

When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missing too

When you're gone
All the words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay, I miss you

I've never felt this way before
Everything that I do
Reminds me of you

And the clothes you left, they lie on the floor
And they smell just like you
I love the things that you do

When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?

When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
And when you're gone
The face I came to know is missing too

And when you're gone
All the words I need to hear
To always get me through the day
And make it okay, I miss you

We were made for each other
Out here forever
I know we were, Yeah-Yeah

And all I ever wanted was for you to know!
Everything I do I'd give my heart and soul!
I can hardly breathe I need to feel you here with me! Yeah-Eh!

When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
And when you're gone
The face I came to know is missing too

And when you're gone
All the words I need to hear
Will always get me through the day
And make it okay, I miss you, MMM
