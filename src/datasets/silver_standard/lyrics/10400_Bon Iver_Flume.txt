I am my mother's only one
It's enough
I wear my garment so it shows
Now you know

Only love is all maroon
Gluey feathers on a flume
Sky is womb and she's the moon

I am my mother on the wall
With us all
I move in water, shore to shore
Nothing's more

Only love is all maroon
Lapping lakes like leery loons
Leaving rope burns, reddish ruse

Only love is all maroon
Gluey feathers on a flume
Sky is womb and she's the moon
