Love can go to your head
Like a shot of somethin' strong
Love can go to your bed
And stay there all night long
Love can go on and on
Like a Sunday mornin' sparrow
Love can to your heart
Like a sweet-talkin' arrow

Love can go to hell
In a broken-heartbeat minute
That's where I am without you in it
Every day's just another night by myself
Love can go to hell
Like roses in a vase o' whiskey
Dyin' for the way you used to kiss me
Heaven knows, I only wish you well
Oh, but love, yeah, love can go to hell

I can go to church
Fold these idle hands
I can go to work
Call some friends, make some plans
I can get drunk on a Saturday night
And try to fall for someone new
But I just wake up hungover
Cursin' the day I fell for you

Love can go to hell
In a broken-heartbeat minute
That's where I am without you in it
Every day is just another night by myself
Love can go to hell
Like roses in a vase o' whiskey
Dyin' for the way you used to kiss me
Heaven knows, I only wish you well

I don't blame you at all
No, I don't hate you at all
It's all love's fault

So love can go to hell
In a broken-heartbeat minute
That's where I am without you in it
Every day is just another night by myself
Love can go to hell
Like roses in a vase o' whiskey
Dyin' for the way you used to kiss me
Heaven knows, I only wish you well
Oh, but love, yeah, love can go to hell

Forever's just a lie that love will tell
So love, yeah, love can go to hell
