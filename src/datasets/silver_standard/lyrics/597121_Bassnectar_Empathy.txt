I find, I Find yourself so wonderful
I Find, I find yourself so

Pulma Gary Payton, Live in your rotation
All your plexy clad I'm snapping back upon your station,
Keep style elevating, you feelin' the sensation
You're higher zone, you're not alone
I know no perimeters, frequency, no limiters
We multiply integers, we back and forth so limitless
I'm positive, negative combined with infinite
You can grab a line on a line this is synergy

Anything you feel na na na, na na na
I can
Anything you feel na na na, na na na
I can

Hands high, hands high
Anything you feel na na na, na na na
Hands high, hands high,
Anything you feel na na na, na na na
Hands high, hands high
