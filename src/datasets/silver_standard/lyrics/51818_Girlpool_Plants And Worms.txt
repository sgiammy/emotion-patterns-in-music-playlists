Your pain is an endless cycle
The globe is a spinning rifle
It's hard to see things simply
When my thoughts are above and in me
I'm uncomfortable looking in the mirror
Seeing that my skin is clearer
You don't have to admit you're faulty to accept that you were born unlawfully
Don't ever go away from home
You'll never know what it's like in the unknown
But exploration opens up my mind
All the plants and the worms live outside
Your pain is an endless cycle
The globe is a spinning rifle
It's hard to see things simply when my thoughts are above and in me
Don't ever go away from home
You'll never know what it's like in the unknown
But exploration opens up my mind
All the plants and the worms live outside
