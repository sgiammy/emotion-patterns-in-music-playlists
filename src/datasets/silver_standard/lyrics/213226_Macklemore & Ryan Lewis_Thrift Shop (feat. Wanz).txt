Hey, Macklemore, can we go thrift shopping?

What? What? What? What?
What? What? What? What?
What? What? What? What?
What? What? What? What?
What? What? What? What?
What? What? What? What?
What? What? What? What?

Ow, ow, ow

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome

Now, walk into the club like "What up? I got a big cock!"
Nah, I'm just pumped, bought some shit from a thrift shop (Ho!)
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
The people like "Damn, that's a cold-ass honky!"

Rolling in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink except my gator shoes, those are green (Ho!)
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standing next to me
Probably shoulda washed this, smells like R. Kelly's sheets (Piss)
But shit, it was ninety-nine cents!

Bag it, copping it, washing it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passing up on those moccasins someone else been has walking in
Bummy and grudgy, fucking it, I am stunting and flossing and
Saving my money and I'm hella happy, that's a bargain, bitch

Imma take your grandpa's style
Imma take your grandpa's style
No for real, ask your grandpa
Can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you!)

Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found, dig it
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board (Ho!)

Hello, hello, my ace man, my Mello
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make them cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like "Ah, he got the Velcros!" (Ho!)

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket (Ho!)
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome

Ow, ow
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket (Ho!)
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome

What you know about rocking a wolf on your noggin?
What you knowing about wearing a fur fox skin? (Ho!)
I'm digging, I'm digging, I'm searching right through that luggage
One man's trash, that's another man's come up (Ho!)

Thank your granddad for donating that plaid button-
Up shirt, 'cause right now, I'm up in here stuntin'
I'm at the Goodwill, you can find me in the (Uptons)
I'm that, I'm that sucker searching in this section (Uptons)

Your grammy, your aunty, your momma, your mammy
I'll take those flannel zebra jammies, secondhand and rock that motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on that motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker (Ho!)

They be like "Oh that Gucci, that's hella tight!"
I'm like "Yo, that's fifty dollars for a t-shirt!"
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
Fifty dollars for a t-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting swindled and pimped, shit
I call that getting tricked by a business (Ho!)
That shirt's hella dough
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't (Ho!)
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Trying to get girls from a brand, man, you hella won't (Ho!)
Man, you hella won't

Ho!

(Goodwill... poppin' tags... yeah)

Ow, ow

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket (Ho!)
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome (Ho!)

I'll wear your granddad's clothes
I look incredible
I'm in this big ass coat 
From that thrift shop down the road

I wear your granddad's clothes (damn right)
I look incredible (Now, c'mon, man)
I'm in this big ass coat (big ass coat)
From that thrift shop down the road (let's go)

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket (Ho!)
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome (Ho!)

Ha, ha, ha
