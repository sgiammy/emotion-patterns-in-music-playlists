Falling, I'm falling, I
Falling, I'm falling, I

Love
It was enough to recognize
To see
I was the reason you feel sick inside

Fall in need
I let you bleed
'Cause you were falling
I'm sorry, ah, baby
'Cause you were falling 
I'm sorry, I

Love
It cut a hole into your eyes
You couldn't see
You were the car I crashed, now you're burning alive

Fall in need
I let you bleed 
'Cause you were falling
I'm sorry, ah, baby
'Cause you were falling 
I'm sorry, I

Babe
The night has swallowed my soul 
Could it be that I fell apart
It shows
The lines on my face ate away my smile 
Could it be that I fell apart

Fall in need
I let you bleed 
'Cause you were falling 
I'm sorry ah, baby

Fall in need (Fall, fall, fall, fall)
I let you bleed 
'Cause you were falling 
I'm sorry ah, baby

Fall in need (Fall, fall, fall, fall)
