Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up
All the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up

Shorty what you want? Shorty what you need?
My niggas run the game, we ain't ever leavin'
Countin' up this money, we ain't never sleepin'
You got V12, I got 12 V's
Got bottles, got weed, got molly
I'm all the way up
Shorty what you want? I got what you need
Shorty what you want? I got what you need
Shorty what you want? I got what you need

I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
All the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up

For my niggas with Bentley coupes and Rolexes
Kicked the bitch out the room and gave her no breakfast
Had to stash the jewels, these bitches so reckless
Keep my hoes on cruise, I'm talkin' naughty nothings
Shorty uptown showin' off her new things
Couldn't take it all so I gave her un chin
She call me top shotta, yeah I keep a few tings
Champion sound, yeah I got a few rings
And I'm all the way up
And you can stay up
And if you ask anybody where I live
They'll point to the hills and say
Go all the way up
Go all the way up

I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up

Just left the big house to a bigger house
Ain't have a girlfriend but the bitch is out
Chanel croc bag, shit ain't even out
With the gold chains, Himalayan, Birkin cocaine
Lit it up, Pac shit, I hit 'em up
I'm talkin' color money, purple yen and blue dirham
I got brown lira, I ain't talkin' 'bout Ross bitch
I'm that nigga on Viagra dick
That means I'm all the way up
And you can stay up
P.O.s say I can't get high
Hopped in the helicopter Uber and said...
Go all the way up
Go all the way up

I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up

Shorty what you want? Shorty what you need?
My niggas run the game, we ain't ever leavin'
Countin' up this money, we ain't never sleepin'
You got V12, I got 12V
Got bottles, got weed, got molly
I'm all the way up
Shorty what you want? I got what you need
Shorty what you want? I got what you need
Shorty what you want? I got what you need

I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up
All the way up
I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
Nothing can stop me, I'm all the way up
