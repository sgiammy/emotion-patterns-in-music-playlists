Fixation on the darkness that engulfs this world
Drain the life force of our people, change
Fixation on the darkness that engulfs this world 
Drain the life force of our people

Return to the womb, new life
Lay your head to rest, mercy
To give you a peace of mind, lay your head to rest

Come together inside, this body is only a shell
Change, the only way we will survive
Light transfiguration of the soul, of the soul, of the mind

Fixation on the darkness that engulfs this world 
Drain the life force of our people

Return to the womb, new life
Lay your head to rest, mercy
To give you a peace of mind, lay your head to rest

Tell them they will not hold us down, it's time for change
It's time for change, change
It's time for change, they will not hold us down, they will not hold us down
It's time for change, it's time for change
