Holly:
I took my love and I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide brought me down 

Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart (with Santana: rise above?)

Holly with Santana:
Can I sail through the changin' ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?

Holly:
Oh, (with Santana and Brittany: oh...oh, oh)
Oh, (with Santana and Brittany: oh...oh, oh...oh...)

Holly with Santana and Brittany:
Well, I've been afraid of changin' 
'Cause I've built my life around you

Holly with Brittany:
But time makes you bolder

Holly with Santana and Brittany:
Children get older
And I'm getting older too

Holly with Santana:
Well...

Holly with Santana and Brittany:
Well, I've been afraid of changin' 
'Cause I've built my life around you

Holly with Brittany:
But time makes you bolder

Holly with Santana and Brittany:
Children get older
And I'm getting older too

Holly:
Well, I'm getting older too 

So, take this love and take it down
Yeah, and if you climb a mountain and you (with Santana and Brittany: turn around)

Holly with Santana and Brittany:
(Holly with Santana: And if) you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills

Holly:
Well, the landslide brought me down 

Holly with Santana and Brittany:
(Holly with Santana: And if) you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills

Holly:
Well, maybe...
Well, maybe...

Holly with Santana and Brittany:
Well, maybe...

Holly:
The landslide will bring you down
