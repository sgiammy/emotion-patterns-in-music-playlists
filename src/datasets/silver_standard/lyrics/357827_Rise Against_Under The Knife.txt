Wake me up inside, tell me there's a reason
Take another step, to get up off my knees
And follow this path of most resistance
Wherever it takes us
Whatever it faces and wherever it leads

So wake me when it's through
I don't want to feel the things that you do (the things that you do)
Don't worry I'll be fine
I just don't want this dream, wake me up inside

Something for the pain, just to kill this feeling
Although we look awake, inside we're all still sleeping
And I've spent my time here alive, but barely there
Do you believe we'll ever make it?
Do you think we'll ever really see?

So wake me when it's through
I don't want to feel the things that you do (the things that you do)
Don't worry I'll be fine
I just don't want this dream, wake me up inside

Wake me up inside
These dreams all die if we let them
Wake me up inside
Today won't start if we just give in
('Cause you'll be anything)

Just wake me when it's through
I don't want to feel the things that you do (the things that you do)
Don't worry I'll be fine
I just don't want this dream, wake me up inside
