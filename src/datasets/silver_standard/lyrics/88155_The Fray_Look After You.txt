If I don't say this now I will surely break
As I'm leaving the one I want to take
Forgive the urgency but hurry up and wait
My heart has started to separate

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Be my baby
Oh-oh oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Be my baby
I'll look after you

There now, steady love, so few come and don't go
Will you won't you, be the one I always know
When I'm losing my control, the city spins around
You're the only one who knows, you slow it down

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Be my baby
Oh-oh oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Be my baby

I'll look after you
I'll look after you


If ever there was a doubt
My love she leans into me
This most assuredly counts
She says most assuredly

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Be my baby
I'll look after you
After you

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Be my baby
Oh-oh oh

It's always half and never whole
You've begun to feel like home
What's mine is yours to leave or take
What's mine is yours to make your own

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Be my baby
Oh-oh oh

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Be my baby
Oh-oh oh

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Be my baby
Oh-oh oh

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Be my baby
Oh-oh oh
