Hit it from the back, watch a nigga bless you
(If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you)
Cryin' in my arms like a nigga wrecked you
(Metro Boomin' want some more, nigga)

Ya alright, alright, alright
You was right, I was wrong
Ya, I should've never ever took her home
Ya, I should've just boned
Ya, fantasy on my phone
Ya, hit it from the back, watch a nigga bless you
Ya, cryin' in my arms like a nigga wrecked you
Talkin' 'bout a broken heart, runnin' to the restroom

Looked at my mama just like we rich
Looked at my bitch like we rich
Said we ain't got no minor setbacks
Countin' all that money, told that nigga just to bet that
I, I know that you ain't got it, boy, why you ain't just say that?
They see I got that money, now his bitch like, "I said that"
I don't pay that ho no mind, I been had that
When I saw my girl, yeah you know I had to bag that
And before me fuck niggas yeah, they had that
Five niggas in includin' me I had to back back
Try to diss me, I take it to your family
I fuck your sister then make sure that she vanish

Ya alright, alright, alright
You was right, I was wrong
Ya, I should've never ever took her home
Ya, I should've just boned
Ya, fantasy on my phone
Ya, hit it from the back, watch a nigga bless you
Ya, cryin' in my arms like a nigga wrecked you
Talkin' 'bout a broken heart, runnin' to the restroom
Ya alright, alright, alright
You was right, I was wrong
Ya, I should've never ever took her home
Ya, I should've just boned
Ya, fantasy on my phone
Ya, hit it from the back, watch a nigga bless you

Like I don't want a war, wanna caress you

Ya alright, alright, alright

Ya, I should've never ever took her home
Ya, I should've just boned
Ya, fantasy on my phone
Ya, hit it from the back, watch a nigga bless you

Talkin' 'bout a broken heart, runnin' to the restroom
