So fine, could you be mine?
Tattoos with the green eyes
I might just call and let you put in work, yeah
Baby, just lay right here
Speed dial, got the green light for you

Anything you want me to, you know I'll do it
Oh, anything that you want me to do, to do
Anything you want me to, you know I'll do it
Oh, anything that you want me to do, to do

Ty Dolla $ign
Look, little baby, won't you be mine?
Swear them other hoes, girl, you got the green light
I'mma take you to Ibiza, run a Visa
If I wasn't tryna hit it, girl, I'd be lying
Private suite reservations for two
Laying with you under palm trees
Take it off, girl, you know I'm tryna taste it
Lay you on the bed while I sip the Bombay
Anything you want

Jeremih
Ay, private jet, I swear
This ain't a Bow Wow challenge, I swear
Skrr, skrr, pull up like, "Yeah"
Hit the mall girl, go and get Chanel
Back up, girl, slow whine
Let's go have a good time
We gon' hit the bed in due time

Wiz Khalifa
Dark shades with my shirt open
On point, keep me so focused
You the type that I could grow with
Girl, you the one, hope you notice it
And when it come to the game, I'm the dopest
Ain't tryna rush, but you may be the closest
To the realest that I've seen in a while
Roll a plane, hold me down
Do my thing and you don't trip
So you know that

Anything you want me to, you know I'll do it
Oh, anything that you want me to do, to do
Anything you want me to, you know I'll do it

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
To do, to do
Anything you want me to, you know I'll do it
Oh, anything that you want me to do, to do
Anything you want me to, you know I'll do it
Oh, anything that you want me to do, to do
