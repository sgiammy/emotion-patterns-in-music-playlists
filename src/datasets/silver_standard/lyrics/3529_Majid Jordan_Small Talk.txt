I gotta talk to you
I gotta talk to you
I gotta talk to you
I gotta talk to you
I got things to say
I got things to say
I've already said too much and I don't wanna rush right now
But I feel so far away
I don't want to rush right now
I gotta talk to you
Am I making a mistake?
Tell me
If you would take this chance
Then I'll take it too
I have these thoughts I keep
I wanna share with you
And when I'm out of luck
I always pray for you
To bring me back to life
You always make me feel good (please don't let me down)
I wanna make you feel good (please just hear me out)
You always make me feel so...
(Please don't let me down)
This is something that means so much to me

I gotta call on you
I gotta call on you
I wanna call on you

I wanna call on you
I got things to say
I got things to say
I've already said too much and I don't wanna rush right now
But I feel so far away
I don't want to rush right now

I gotta talk to you
Am I making a mistake?
Tell me

If you would take this chance
Then I'll take it too
I have these thoughts I keep
I wanna share with you
And when I'm out of luck
I always pray for you
To bring me back to life
You always make me feel good (please don't let me down)
I wanna make you feel good (please just hear me out)

You always make me feel so...
(Please don't let me down)
This is something that means so much to me
Oh so much to me

Please don't let me down

Please don't let me down like this
Just hear me out
Could you show me what I miss?
Don't let me down
Hear me out a little bit

(Am I making a mistake?)
Please don't let me down
Please don't let me down like this

(Am I making a mistake?)
Just hear me out
Could you show me what I miss
I don't know where you're going
I just know that we're apart
But I wanna end up wherever you are

If you would take this chance
Then I'll take it too
I have these thoughts I keep
I wanna share with you
And when I'm out of luck
I always pray for you
To bring me back to life
You always make me feel good (please don't let me down)
I wanna make you feel good (please just hear me out)
You always make me feel so...
(Please don't let me down)
This is something that means so much to me
Oh so much to me
