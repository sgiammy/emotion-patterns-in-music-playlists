Snapbacks and tattoos, snapbacks and tattoos
Nice whips, fly chicks, all that 'cause cash rules
Snapbacks and tattoos, snapbacks and tattoos
Nice whips, fly chicks, all that 'cause cash rules

Show off your hats, show off your tatts
Show off your arms, legs, chest, show off your back
Snapbacks and tattoos, snapbacks and tattoos
Nice whips, fly chicks, all that 'cause cash rules

Okay, now snapbacks and tattoos, rap phat, I'm that dude
My backpack got cash that I make an ass clap like tap shoes
I'm international, y'all niggas vaginal
I pass through, fresh to death, you've now entered swag school

Ladies holding kisses, swag as cold as sickness
Teen Driicky tatted on 'em 'cause they ass is so ridiculous
In the 'Mazzi, paparazzi, man they can't control the pictures
M.O.B. tatt, screaming money over bitches

My clothes and tatts, they're all custom though
Something that you ain't accustom to
Don't collapse with the Huxtables
Hoes like hats, they adjustable

This is for my ladies and my fellas getting gravy
But your body's marked up like the train back in the 80's
I've been through the test, now, I've ink on my chest
Trying to triple my chest, I spit through the rest

Buy you a Mitchell and Ness, fly and it'll fit you the best
From NY to LA, North Cackalack to Baton Rouge
All across the latitude
Everybody rockin' them

Show off your hats, show off your tatts
Show off your arms, legs, chest, show off your back
Snapbacks and tattoos, snapbacks and tattoos

In my hood they wear them snapbacks and tattoos
Clack clack and snatch jewels
Pack tools, crap shoot and sell crack in glass tubes
Our chicks? Attitudes, hard enough to get at a dude

Tatted up, fattest butt, suck it off, vacuum
Trips to Miami Ink, after that, Lowrider
When I say we balling trick
I don't mean no globetrotter

Driicky is a monster, ain't a heir up in his safe
Since I murder raps, I should tatt a tear up on my face
Can't you hear this flow? It's evil
Can't be near us close to lethal

Y'all are weird
Yo, I'm just here to spit 'bout piercings, clothes, and needles
Grab some cheer-up for the people
Rappers fear 'cause most are feeble
I don't have to smoke I rap the dope considered so illegal

To all my G's up, can I just get a witness?
If you're inked up, from the feet up or you're stylin' in a Mitch-Ness
Ain't leaving out my females, I'm talking 'bout that ass too
Show 'em all, roll call, let them bitches know we wear them

Snapbacks and tattoos, snapbacks and tattoos
