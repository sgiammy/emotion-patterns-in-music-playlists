On top of the roof the air is so cold and so calm
I say your name in silence, you don't wanna hear it right now
The eyes of the city are counting the tears falling down
Each one a promise of everything you never found

I scream into the night for you
Don't make it true
Don't jump
The lights will not guide you through
They're deceiving you
Don't jump
Don't let memories go
Of me and you
The world is down there out of view
Please don't jump

You open your eyes but you can't remember what for
The snow falls quietly you just can't feel it no more
Somewhere out there
You lost yourself in your pain
You dream of the end to start all over again

I scream into the night for you
Don't make it true
Don't jump
The lights will not guide you through
They're deceiving you
Don't jump
Don't let memories go
Of me and you
The world is down there out of view
Please don't jump
Don't jump

I scream into the night for you
Don't make it true
Don't jump
The lights will not guide you through
They're deceiving you
Don't jump
Don't let memories go
Of me and you
The world is down there out of view
Please don't jump
Don't jump

I don't now how long
I can hold you- so strong

I don't now how long

Just take my hand
And give it a chance
Don't jump

I scream into the night for you
Don't make it true
Don't jump
The lights will not guide you through
They're deceiving you
Don't jump
Don't let memories go
Of me and you
The world is down there out of view
Please don't jump
Don't jump

And if all that can't hold you back
Then I'll jump for you
