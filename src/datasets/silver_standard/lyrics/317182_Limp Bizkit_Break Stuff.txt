It's just one of those days
When you don't wanna wake up
Everything is fucked
Everybody sucks

You don't really know why
But you wanna justify
Rippin' someone's head off

No human contact
And if you interact
Your life is on contract
Your best bet is to stay away
Motherfucker
It's just one of those days

It's all about the he-said
She-said bullshit
I think you better quit
Lettin' shit slip
Or you'll be leavin'
With a fat lip

It's all about the he-said
She-said bullshit
I think you better quit
Talkin' that shit

It's just one of those days
Feelin' like a freight train
First one to complain
Leaves with a blood stain

Damn right, I'm a maniac
You better watch your back
'Cause I'm fucking up
Your program

And if you're stuck up
Your just locked up
Next in line to get fucked up
Your best bet is to stay away
Motherfucker
It's just one of those days

It's all about the he-said
She-said bullshit
I think you better quit
Lettin' shit slip
Or you'll be leavin'
With a fat lip

It's all about the he-said
She-said bullshit
I think you better quit
Talkin' that shit, punk
So come and get it

I feel like shit
My suggestion
Is to keep your distance
'Cause right now I'm dangerous

We've all felt like shit
And been treated like shit
All those motherfuckers
Who want to step up
I hope you know I pack a chainsaw
I'll skin your ass raw

And if my day
Keeps goin' this way
I just might
Break somethin' tonight

I pack a chainsaw
I'll skin your ass raw
And if my day
Keeps goin' this way
I just might
Break somethin' tonight

I pack a chainsaw
I'll skin your ass raw
And if my day
Keeps going this way
I just might
Break your fuckin' face tonight

Give me stuff to break
Give me stuff to break
Just give me stuff to break
How 'bout your fuckin' face

I hope you know
I'm like a chainsaw
(What)
A chainsaw
(What)
A motherfuckin' chainsaw
(What)
So come and get it

It's all about the he-said
She-said bullshit
I think you better quit
Lettin' shit slip
Or you'll be leavin'
With a fat lip

It's all about the he-said
She-said bullshit
I think you better quit
Talkin' that shit, punk
So come and get it
