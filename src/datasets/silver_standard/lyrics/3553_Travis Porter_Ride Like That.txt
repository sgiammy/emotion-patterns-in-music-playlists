Your nails, nails on my back

Her feet's white as cocaine, I shot her with Aquafine
I know she wanna ride it, I can tell by her demeaner
And me and shawty get a real good vibe
She dripping now down her thighs

The best thing, you can look in my eyes
Then when it's over, I can see the sky
It's just something I can't deny, I heal by the economy
Wanna be my private dancer, come with me to ecstasy
Whistle's so wet and she ride it like a jet ski
Fly down to Atlanta, shawy get the best of me

Bottles in the club and they on me
She said that she body gonna have to show me
But give me a second so can you hold please?

Don't act like that, I'ma be right, right back
Do you really really like it like that?

Baby girl don't act like that

Didn't know you would stand like that
And I didn't know you could bring it back like that

As long as you do it, we do it, we did it
We can do it every time when I'm in the city
Waist so skinny with a face so pretty
Girl it's your time, wanna taste your city like

Ah, ah, ah, she scream out loud when I hit it from the back
She fine as hell and don't know how to act
She say she never did it, never tried
She sitting up, telling up motherfucking lies

No, no, don't act like that
I know I told you I'd be right, right back
As long as you can bring that right back
