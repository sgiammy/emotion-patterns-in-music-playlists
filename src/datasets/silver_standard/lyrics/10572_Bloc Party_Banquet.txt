A heart of stone, a smoking gun
I can give you life, I can take it away
A heart of stone, a smoking gun
I'm workin' it out, I'm

Why'd you feel so underrated?
Why'd you feel so negated?

Turning away from the light
Becoming adult
Turning into myself

I wanted to bite, not destroy
To feel her underneath
Turning into the light

She don't think straight
No, no, no, she don't think straight

She's got such a dirty mind and it never ever stops
And you don't taste like her and you never ever will
And we don't read the papers, we don't read the news
Heaven's never enough, we will never be fooled

Turning away from the light
Becoming adult
Turning into myself

I wanted to bite, not destroy
To feel her underneath
Turning into the light

And if you feel (And if you feel)
A little left behind (A little left behind)
We will wear you on the other side

And if you feel (And if you feel)
A little left behind (A little left behind)
We will wear you on the other side

'Cause I'm on fire
'Cause you know I'm on fire when you come
'Cause you know I'm on fire
'Cause you know I'm on fire, so stub me out

'Cause I'm on fire
'Cause I'm on fire
'Cause I'm on fire
'Cause I'm on fire
