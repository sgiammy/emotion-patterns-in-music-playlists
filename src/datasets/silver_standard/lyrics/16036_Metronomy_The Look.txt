You're up and you'll get down
You never running from this town

Kinda think you said
You'll never get anything better than this

'Cause you're going round in circles
And everyone knows you're trouble

Cause you read it in a big book
And now you giving me the look look
But just remember how we shook shook
And all the things we took took

This town's the oldest friend of mine

Get up and we get down
We're always running round this town

And to think I said
We'd never make anything better than this

'Cause we're always in small circles
And everyone thinks we're trouble

We didn't read it in the big book
(We didn't read in a big book, big book, big book)
And now we're giving you the look, look
(Giving you the look ah, giving you the look ah)
Just remember how we shook, shook (shook, shook, shook, shook)
And all the things we took, took (took, took, took, took)

(This town, this town) This town's the oldest friend of mine

(This town, this town, this town)
