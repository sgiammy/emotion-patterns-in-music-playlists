Emergency call, this is our code red
Put your hands up high, put them in the air
You know what we do and we do it well
In a world full of lies we live to tell

For all the years that
You've been feeding us all that trash
You wasted time

Kick out the epic motherfucker
Kick out the epic motherfucker
Kick out the epic motherfucker

In a world full of lies we live to tell
