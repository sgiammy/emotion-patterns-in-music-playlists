Love to hate repeating my mistakes
Now there's no one left to listen, no one left to listen
Take a chance, a fucked up consequence,
When there's no one left to listen, no one left to listen

Right now we're taking control
Tired of waiting, tired of waiting for something new
Right now we're taking control
Tired of waiting, tired of waiting for something new
Something new, something new, something new

á¹–ressed the knife and feed the sacrifice
When there's no one left to listen, no one left to listen
Say goodbye, you will die tonight
And now everyone will listen, everyone will listen

'Cause it's never enough to know the truth
When you lost all you know, there's nothing to lose

Right now we're taking control
Tired of waiting, tired of waiting for something new
Right now we're taking control
Tired of waiting, tired of waiting for something new
Right now we're taking control
Tired of waiting, tired of waiting for something new
Something new, something new, something new
