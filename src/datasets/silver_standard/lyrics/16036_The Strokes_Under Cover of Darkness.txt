Slip back out of whack at your best
It's a nightmare
So I'm joining the army

No house phones, but can I still call?
Will you wait for me now?

We've got the right to live, fight to use it
Got everything and you can just choose it
I won't just be a puppet on a string

Don't go that way
I'll wait for you

And I'm tired of all your friends
Listening at your door
And I want what's better for you
So long, my friend and adversary
Oh, but I'll wait for you

Get dressed, jump out of bed, you do it best
Are you okay?
I've been out around this town
Everybody's singing the same song for ten years

I'll wait for you
Will you wait for me too?

And they sacrifice their lives
And they lied about those odds
Oh, they've said it a billion times
And they'll say it again
So long, my adversary and friend

Don't go that way
I'll wait for you

I'm tired of all your friends
Banging down your door
Get up in the morning
Yelling no more

So long (yelling no more)
My friend (yelling no more)
And adversary (yelling no more)
I'll be waiting for you
