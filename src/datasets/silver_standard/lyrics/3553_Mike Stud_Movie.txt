I got all my friends coming through
And you should bring your friends too
It's gonna be a movie, yeah it'll be a movie (x2)

Ooh girl, look at you
Hips don't lie, well you the truth
Drop it low, whoa, you got my attention
Now let me check it like Ovechkin
Girl you know I want it, so I'm glad you came
Now run it, run it - like your name is Usain
Like ooh, kill 'em - like Terio
Ooh, kill 'em - no burial
Can't stand the heat then move to Cleveland
Only here for the weekend, bring a freak friend in a hurry
Always looking for that three, Steph Curry
I'm like Hannah Montana, Hannah Montana
Let's make a movie, get it on camera
And it'll be the best of your life
I met her once, hit it twice, that's a hell of a night

I got all my friends coming through
And you should bring your friends too
It's gonna be a movie, yeah it'll be a movie (x2)

We just young and independent
Drink like it's a race and we about to win the pennant
Got me feeling like the man around here
Turn up so real, nothing fake around here
And I got her drinking liquor by the liter
Tryna keep her on her toes like a ballerina
And that Ciroc help me get to know her
Got her getting out of line like I know the owner
Like you, you, you and you should come with me
We gon' make a movie and I need you for a scene
I'm just tryna get it, watch me move like a player
Hit her so good it's like I'm doing her a favor
Like thank you, ma'am, take my hand
Yeah this your favorite jam to make you dance
And don't make no plans, 'cause we gon' get it tonight
And when you live like it's a movie, that's a hell of a life

I got all my friends coming through
And you should bring your friends too
It's gonna be a movie, yeah it'll be a movie (x2)

If you feeling like I'm feeling, get your hands up high
Cause this liquor that we're sipping got us feeling all right
You could bring your friends, I could bring mine
Party don't stop, we could do this all night
You could bring your friends, I could bring mine
Party don't stop, we could do this all night

I got all my friends coming through
And you should bring your friends too
It's gonna be a movie, yeah it'll be a movie (x2)
