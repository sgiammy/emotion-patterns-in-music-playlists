(...Hi there!
Careful with the steps
Get a drink, have a good time now
Welcome to paradise, paradise, paradise...)

I found the world so new

Since I left you
I found the world so new

I found the world so new...

Since I left you
I found the world so new
Everyday

Since I left you
I found the world so new
Everyday

Since I left you
I found the world so new
Everyday

Since I left you
I found the world so new...
