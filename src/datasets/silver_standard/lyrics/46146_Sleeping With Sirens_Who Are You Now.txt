Yeah! x2
Don't wake me up if I'm sleeping this life away
Tell me that I'll never be good enough
Sometimes it hurts to think it could really be that way
It won't be that way.

I'm tired and I'm lost
I don't wanna be found
I put my heart and my soul
And strength in this now.

So forgive me 'cause I won't forget that
Yeah, this world has changed me
So you know when you ask me.

Who are you now?
Did you say what you want?
Don't go back to the start
I'm asking, who are you now?
Did they break you apart?
Won't you fight back for what you want?

Sometimes you gotta fall before you fly
We're gonna work it out.

Yeah! x2

Don't, don't, don't wake me up
'Cause I hate who I am today
So come on, come on
And just take, take, take what you want
Is it now what we're living for?
We're always wanting more.

You made me hate my own reflection
Question every choice I make
So I could try to be perfect
But I will try to be fake.

So forgive me 'cause I really could care less that
This world has changed me
So you know when you ask me.

Who are you now?
Did you say what you want?
Don't go back to the start
I'm asking, who are you now?
Did they break you apart?
Won't you fight back for what you want?

Sometimes you gotta fall before you fly
And sometimes you really live, you've gotta try
We can change it all together, in the end you're gonna find
That what we felt in our hearts was real the whole time
When you open up your eyes, I hope that you find
Who you are? x2
Who are you now? x2

Who are you now?
Did you say what you want?
Don't go back to the start
I'm asking, who are you now?
Did they break you apart?
Won't you fight back for what you want?

Sometimes you gotta fall before you fly, x2
We're gonna work it out.
