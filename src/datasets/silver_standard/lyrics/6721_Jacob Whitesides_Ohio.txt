At 14 I used to talk to myself
Paint my bedroom with stars
One for each time my dad flaked out
Got a galaxy of scars
You know that feeling that you get when ya start to run out of breath
And ya pass out, wake up, wig out not knowing where you are

I'm safer here inside my submarine
'Cause when I'm under water you can't say anything
I can't hear anything

O-o-o-ohio
I don't need Hollywood
I don't need New York heights or Las Vegas lights
I need O-o-o-ohio
I've never even been there
But I'd rather fall asleep in an open field in Ohio
Ohio
Ohio
Ohi

Last time I saw your face
You were screaming that I don't have a clue
I'm not a deadbeat piece of shit
Dad, I'll never learn that from you
You know that feeling when you're weak
And ya, wish your brain could delete for ya,
All the types of twisted contradictions that I worked so hard to lose

I'm safer here inside my submarine
'Cause when I'm under water you can't throw words at me
I'm just learning how to leave

O-o-o-ohio
I don't need Hollywood
I don't need New York heights or Las Vegas lights
I need O-o-o-ohio
I've never even been there
But I'd rather fall asleep in an open field in Ohio
Ohio
Ohio
Ohio
Ohio
Ohio
Ohio
Ohio

Growing up, and we're all dying
Growing up, and we're all trying
Growing up, and we're all dying
Growing up, and we're all trying
Growing up, and we're all dying
Growing up, and we're all trying

O-o-o-ohio
I don't need Hollywood
I don't need New York heights or Las Vegas lights
I need O-o-o-ohio
I've never even been there
But I'd rather fall asleep in an open field in Ohio
