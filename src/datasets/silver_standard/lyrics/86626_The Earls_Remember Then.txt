Re-mem-mem, re-mem-mem-mem-ber oop-shoop
Re-mem-mem, re-mem-mem-mem-ber oop-shoop
Re-mem-mem, re-mem-mem-mem-ber oop-shoop then
Then, remember then

(Mixture)
(Backups continue with intro while lead sings a series of "whoa oh-oh's" and a "Remember then")

That night we fell in love
Beneath the stars above
That was a lovely summer night
Pyramid Remember then, then, then, then, then

(Mixture again)

Summer's over
Our love is over
To lose that love was such a sin
Pyramid Remember then, then, then, then, then

[Backups:] Remember, re-mem-mem, mem-mem-mem-mem-ber
[Lead:] Our love is in the past
[Backups:] patta-past
[Lead:] Oh, has it gone so fast
[Backups:] patta-past
[Lead:] Why couldn't our love last?
[Backups:] Can't last
[Backups:] Wop, wop, patta patta pop-pop, shoo-wop-dah bop bop, ooh

I'm broken-hearted now
Since we have parted now
My mind wanders now and then
Pyramid Remember then, then, then, then, then

[Backups:] Re-mem-mem, re-mem-mem-mem-ber
(Mixture again)

(New mixture Backups sing several "oop shoop, shang-a lang, jigga bop's" and the lead does "ah-ooh-ooh" and other falsetto variations)

(Fade)
