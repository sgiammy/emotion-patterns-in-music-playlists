Pardon me while I burst
Pardon me while I burst

A decade ago, I never thought I would be at twenty-three
On the verge of spontaneous combustion, woe is me
But I guess that it comes with the territory
An ominous landscape of never ending calamity

I need you to hear, I need you to see
That I have had all I can take
And exploding seems like a definite possibility
To me

So pardon me while I burst into flames
I've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame
Pardon me, pardon me, I'll never be the same

Not two days ago, I was having a look in a book
And I saw a picture of a guy fried up above his knees
I said, "I can relate," 'cause lately I've been thinking
Of combustication as a welcome vacation from

The burdens of the planet Earth
Like gravity, hypocrisy and the perils of being in 3-D
But thinking so much differently

Pardon me while I burst into flames
I've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame
Pardon me, pardon me, I'll never be the same
Never be the same

Pardon me while I burst into flames
Pardon me, pardon me, pardon me

So pardon me while I burst into flames
I've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame
Pardon me, pardon me, I'll never be the same
(Pardon me) never be the same, yeah
