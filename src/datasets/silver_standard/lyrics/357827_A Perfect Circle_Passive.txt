"Dead as dead can be"
My doctor tells me
But I just can't believe him
Ever the optimistic one

I'm sure of
Your ability
To become
My perfect enemy

Wake up and face me
Don't play dead, 'cause maybe
Someday I will walk away and say
"You disappoint me"
Maybe you're better off this way

Leaning over you here
Cold and catatonic
I catch a brief reflection
Of what you could and might have been

It's your right
And your ability
To become
My perfect enemy

Wake up (we'll catch you)
And face me (come on now)
Don't play dead (don't play dead)
'Cause maybe (because maybe)
Someday I will (someday I'll)
Walk away and say
"You disappoint me"
Maybe you're better off this way
Maybe you're better off this way
Maybe you're better off this way
Maybe you're better off this way
You're better off this
You're better off this
Maybe you're better off

Wake up (why can't you?)
And face me (come on now)
Don't play dead (don't play dead)
'Cause maybe (because maybe)
Someday I will (someday I'll)
Walk away and say
"You fucking disappoint me"
Maybe you're better off this way

Go ahead and play dead
I know that you can hear this
Go ahead and play dead
Why can't you turn and face me?
Why can't you turn and face me?
Why can't you turn and face me?
Why can't you turn and face me?
You fucking disappoint me
