So please just save your words
Another parody of yourself
I'm sure through time you'll see
We're all headed straight to hell

You prey on the weaked minds
Your mighty God created
You think that gives you divine right
To pass your narrow judgement

Here I stand before you
Sell me your greatest lie
I'll inhale your weekend followers
Exhaled to the world to die

I'm setting fires around you
I'll expose your truth

There is no pure intention
Just greed, filth and lust
On your knees you bottom feeder
Just numbers you entrust

Here I stand before you
Sell me your greatest lie
I'll inhale your weekend followers
Exhaled to the world to die

I'm setting fires around you
I'll expose your truth

I will burn you down

I'm setting fires to burn you down
I'm setting fire for the whole world to see
I'm breathing fire
Bring humanity to its' knees
