When I get chills at night 
I feel it deep inside without you, yeah 
Know how to satisfy 
Keeping that tempo right without you, yeah 

Pictures in my mind on replay 
I'm gonna touch the pain away 
I know how to scream my own name 
Scream my name 

(I love me) 
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else 
(Hey) 
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else 
(I love me) 
Can't help myself, no, I don't need anybody else 
Anytime, day or night 
(I love me) 
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else 
(Hey) 
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else 
(I love me) 
Can't help myself, no, I don't need anybody else 
Anytime that I like 
(I love me) 

I'll take it nice and slow 
Feeling good on my phone without you, yeah 
Got me speaking in tongues 
The beautiful, it comes without you, yeah 

I'm gonna put my body first 
And love me so hard 'til it hurts 
I know how to scream out the words 
Scream the words 

(I love me) 
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else 
(Hey) 
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else 
(I love me) 
Can't help myself, no, I don't need anybody else 
Anytime, day or night 
(I love me) 
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else 
(Hey) 
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else 
(I love me) 
Can't help myself, no, I don't need anybody else 
Anytime that I like 
(I love me) 

Ah, la la la, la la la la la 
Ah, la la la, la la la la la 
Ah, la la la, la la la la la 
Anytime that I like 
(I love) 

I know how to scream my own name 
Scream my name 

(I love me) 
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else 
(Hey) 
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else 
(I love me) 
Can't help myself, no, I don't need anybody else 
Anytime, day or night 
(I love me) 
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else 
(Hey) 
Gonna love myself, no, I don't need anybody else 
(I love me) 
Can't help myself, no, I don't need anybody else 
Anytime that I like 
(I love me)
