Every night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you
Go on

Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you
Go on

Near
Far
Wherever you are
I believe that
The heart does go on
Once more
You open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

Love can touch us one time
And last for a lifetime
And never let go
'Till we're gone

Love was when I loved you
One true time I hold to
In my life we'll always
Go on

Near
Far
Wherever you are
I believe that
The heart does go on
Once more
You open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

You're here
There's nothing I fear
And I know that
My heart will go on
We'll stay
Forever this way
You are safe in my heart
And my heart will go on and on
