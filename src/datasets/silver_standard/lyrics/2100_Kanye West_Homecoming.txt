Yeah
And you say Chi-City?
Chi-City, Chi-City

Chris Martin and Kanye West:
I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then? (Yeah)
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again
I'm in home again (Ow)

Kanye West:
I met this girl when I was 3 years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said "Excuse me lil homey, I know you don't know me
But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees"
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astounding
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, "'Ye, keep making that keep making that platinum and gold for me"

Chris Martin:
I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again
I'm in home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then? Oh
Now I'm coming home again
Maybe we could start again

Kanye West:
But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't have never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her
It always seems like she talking 'bout me
She said, "You left your kids, and they just like you
They want to rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you" and I just got through
Talking 'bout what we tryna do: just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview I'm representing you, making you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talking 'bout Chi-Town

Chris Martin:
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again
I'm in home again
Maybe, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan, oh
Now I'm coming home again
I'm in home again
Maybe you, do you remember when?
Fireworks at Lake Michigan, oh
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

Loyee oyeee oh, loyee oyeee oh
I'm in home again
Loyee oyeee oh, loyee oyeee oh
I'm in home again
Maybe we can start again
