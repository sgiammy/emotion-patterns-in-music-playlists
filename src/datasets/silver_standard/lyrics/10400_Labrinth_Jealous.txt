I'm jealous of the rain
That falls upon your skin
It's closer than my hands have been
I'm jealous of the rain

I'm jealous of the wind
That ripples through your clothes
It's closer than your shadow
I'm jealous of the wind

So I wished you the best of all this world could give
And I told you when you left me there's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back
Tell me all you found was heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way you're happy without me

I'm jealous of the nights
That I don't spend with you
I'm wondering who you lay next to
Oh I'm jealous of the nights

I'm jealous of the love,
Love that was in here
Gone for someone else to share
Oh I'm jealous of the love

So I wished you the best of all this world could give
And I told you when you left me there's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back
Tell me all you found was heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way you're happy without me

As I sink in the sand
Watch you slip through my hands
Oh, as I die here another day
'Cause all I do is cry behind the smile

I wished you the best of all this world could give
And I told you when you left me there's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back
Tell me all you found was heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way you're happy without me
It's hard for me to say
I'm jealous of the way you're happy without me
