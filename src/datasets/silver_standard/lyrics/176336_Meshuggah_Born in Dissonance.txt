We are origin, we are increate
You will see our coming for a thousand years
Every violent element incarnate made flesh and fused to one

You may call us remnant, as we are all that will be left

Brought forth by ancient whisper
Deployed by inverse suns
To capture the essence of creation and render it undone

We come to make all things collide
Those joules define what we are
An energy born in dissonance
Long before first ever star

Baptized in the river you call time
We know that we are sacred
In human tongue we're apocalypse
For we bring with us obliteration

Through spectacles tuned to infinity, 
You will see our coming for a thousand years
You will know us then for what we truly are
The realization of every fear
