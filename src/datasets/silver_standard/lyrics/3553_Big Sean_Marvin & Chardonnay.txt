Early in the morning
When she's all alone
Imma take my time
Do it how we want it
Just to set the mood, girl I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Yeah

She love the way I'm doing it
So GOOD she won't put my tattoo on it
Bottom line is, you the finest
Gave you a new name (what's that, what's that?)
My bitch
Hold up, hol' up, whoa there
Let's capture this moment if I ? than I own it
Want it every mornin'
And Patronin' girl, we grownin'
Waddup, got me feeling like a kid with the street lights on
Street lights on
You know I got it going till it's

Early in the morning
When she's all alone
Imma take my time
Do it how we want it
Just to set the mood, girl I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
Just let the song play
The long way
The strong way
It's our day
It's our way
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

(Kanye West)
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up

Talk to the, talk to the hand
You talking to a grown ass man
It's like, way way way too much in your pants for us not to make the bed squeak
(There goes the bed sheets)
Err'ybody rip the swag off
'Fore I rip the tag off
Why my pants sag off, 'cause I'm rappin' my ass off
Flow so ugly, money so handsome
This the fucking anthem, get it, the fucking anthem

(Kanye West)
I don't really wanna uh talk too much
But you love it when I talk like I lost it
And I love how you look when ya blazin'
And I swear you turn at least half asian
And we 'bout to have a liaison
She cool, get head with her shades on (whoa)
You should just go and throw a cape on (whoa)
And it's just so amazing
So amazing
So amazing

(Big Sean)
Take it to the car, bloop, bloop, that shit look like I'm speed racing
Leavin' with me, it'll boost your reputation
West side is where I'm stationed
Spend all night, just champagne tasting
Ain't no rush girl, let's just pace it till it's...

And this was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
