Call it how it is
Hendrix
I promise, I swear I swear
Spit it
Yo

Percocets
Molly, Percocets
Percocets
Molly, Percocets
Rep the set
Gotta rep the set
Chase a check
Never chase a bitch
Mask on
Fuck it, mask off
Mask on
Fuck it, mask off
Percocets
Molly, Percocets
Chase a check
Never chase a bitch

Two cups
Toast up with the gang
From food stamps
To a whole nother domain
Out the bottom
I'm a living proof
They compromising
Half a million on the coupe
Drug houses
Looking like Peru
Graduated
I was overdue
Pink molly
I can barely move
Ask about me
I'm going bust a move
Rick James
33 chains
Old Chanel
Crusing Biscayne
Top off
That's a liability
Hit the gas
Boosting my adrenaline

Percocets
Molly, Percocets
Percocets
Molly, Percocets
Rep the set
Gotta rep the set
Chase a check
Never chase a bitch
Mask on
Fuck it, mask off
Mask on
Fuck it, mask off

Molly, Percocets
Chase a check
Never chase a bitch

Before the Maybach
I'd drive anything
Buy my Range
Make 'em go insane
My guillotine
Drank promethazine
Tek and beams
Go to those extremes
Parliament
Call up Mari wins
Parlay in Vegas
We was in attendance
Before the business
Theodore lenses
Whole prescriptions
Focus on the missions
Intermission
Never take a break
Switch states
Touch down, foreign plates
Ain't no way
Ain't no fucking way
You come to play
We didn't come to play
Rob the bank
We gone rob the game
They gang, we gang
But they are not the same

Percocets
Molly, Percocets
Percocets
Molly, Percocets
Rep the set
Gotta rep the set
Chase a check
Never chase a bitch
Mask on
Fuck it, mask off
Mask on
Fuck it, mask off
Percocets
Molly, Percocets
Chase a check
Never chase a bitch

Mask on
Fuck it, mask off
Mask on
Fuck it, mask off
Mask on
Fuck it, mask off
Gas gone
Never nod huh
