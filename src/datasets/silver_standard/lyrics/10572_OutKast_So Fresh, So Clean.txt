Ain't nobody dope as me, I'm dressed so fresh, so clean

Don't you think I'm so sexy, I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
Ain't nobody dope as me, I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
I love when you stare at me, I'm dressed so fresh, so clean

Sir Luscious gots gator belts and patty melts
And Monte Carlo's and El Dorados
I'm wakin' up out of my slumber feeling like Rollo, so follow
It's Showtime at the Apollo minus the Kiki Shepards
What about a ho in a leopard-print
Teddy Pendergrass, cooler than Freddie Jackson sippin a milkshake
In a snowstorm, left her throat warm in the dorm room at the A.U.
We blew hay too, athletes might cake you
But you must have me mistaken with them statements that you make
Cause

Ain't nobody dope as me, I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
Don't you think I'm so sexy, I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
Ain't nobody dope as me, I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
I love when you stare at me, I'm dressed so fresh, so clean

Canary yellow seven-nine Seville is on display
My nigga Bongo hooked it up, Omar gon' dip my rims today
So a nigga can ride out to the Honeycomb Hideout
I'm-a show you how to wild out like Jack Tripper
Let me be bambino on your snipples
YKK on yo zipper, lick you like a lizard when I'm slizzard
Or sober, six million ways to fold ya
Like Noah's, I get two's of youse and you get pretty D
But I'll call yo ass round eightish, I know you'll be there for me
Girl

Ain't nobody dope as me, I'm dressed so fresh, so clean

Those huge baby eyes get to runnin' off at they mouth
And tellin' me everything that's on yo nasty mind
They say you're malnutritioned, in need of vitamin D
And invitin' me to that tingle in your spine
I love who you are, I love who you ain't, you're so Anne Frank
Let's hit the attic to hide out for bout two weeks
Rick James and no chains and whips
I do suck lips till hips jerk
In double time, the boy next door's a freak
Ha, ha

Ain't nobody dope as me, I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
Don't you think I'm so sexy, I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
Ain't nobody dope as me, I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
(So fresh and so clean, clean)
I love when you stare at me, I'm dressed so fresh, so clean

(Ah we are) The coolest motherfunkers on the planet
(Ah my my) The sky is fallin', ain't no need to panic
(Ah ooh ooh) I got a stick and want yo automatic
(Ah ooh ooh) Compatible, created in the attic
