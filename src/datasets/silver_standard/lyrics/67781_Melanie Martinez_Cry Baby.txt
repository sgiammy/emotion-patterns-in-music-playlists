You seem to replace your brain with your heart
You take things so hard and then you fall apart
You try to explain but before you can start
Those cry baby tears come out of the dark

Someone's turning the handle
To the faucet in your eyes
You pour it out where everyone can see
Your heart's too big for your body
That's why you won't fit inside
You pour it out where everyone can see

They call you cry baby, cry baby, but you don't fucking care
Cry baby, cry baby, still you laugh through your tears
Cry baby, cry baby 'cause you don't fucking care
Tears fall to the ground, you just let them drown

You just let them drown
Cry baby, cry baby

You're all on your own and you lost all your friends
You told yourself that it's not you, it's them
You're one of a kind and no one understands
But those cry baby tears keep coming back again

Someone's turning the handle
To the faucet in your eyes
You pour it out where everyone can see
Your heart's too big for your body
That's why you won't fit inside
You pour it out where everyone can see

They call you cry baby, cry baby, but you don't fucking care
Cry baby, cry baby, still you laugh through your tears
Cry baby, cry baby 'cause you don't fucking care
Tears fall to the ground, you just let them drown

Cry baby, cry baby
You just let them drown
Cry baby, cry baby
You just let them drown

I look at you and I see myself
And I know you better than anyone else
And I have same the faucet in my eyes
So your tears are mine

They call me cry baby, cry baby, but I don't fucking care
Cry baby, cry baby, I laugh through my tears
Cry baby, cry baby 'cause I don't fucking care
Tears fall to the ground, I just let them drown

Cry baby, cry baby
I just let them drown
Cry baby, cry baby
You just let them drown

They call you cry baby, cry baby
I just let them drown
Cry baby, cry baby
You just let them drown
