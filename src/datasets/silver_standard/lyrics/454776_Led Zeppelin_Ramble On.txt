The leaves are falling all around, time I was on my way
Thanks to you, I'm much obliged for such a pleasant stay
But now it's time for me to go, the autumn moon lights my way
For now I smell the rain, and with it, pain
And it's headed my way
Ah, sometimes I grow so tired
But I know I've got one thing I got to do

Ramble on, and now's the time, the time is now
Sing my song, I'm going 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
Ramble on, gotta find the queen of all my dreams

Got no time for spreading roots, the time has come to be gone
And though our health we drank a thousand times
It's time to ramble on

Ramble on, and now's the time, the time is now
Sing my song, I'm going 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
I gotta ramble on, I gotta find the queen of all my dreams

I tell you no lie

Mine's a tale that can't be told, my freedom I hold dear
How years ago in days of old when magic filled the air
Twas in the darkest depths of Mordor, I met a girl so fair
But Gollum, and the evil one crept up and slipped away with her, her, her, yeah
And ain't nothing I can do, no
I guess I'll keep on rambling, I'm gonna shake
Sing my song, I've gotta find my baby
I'm gonna ramble on, sing my song, gonna work my way, going 'round the world, baby, baby
Ramble on, yeah

I can't stop this feeling in my heart
Every time I think about my babe, I really got to part
I gotta keep searching for my baby
I gotta keep-a searching for my baby

I can't find my bluebird
