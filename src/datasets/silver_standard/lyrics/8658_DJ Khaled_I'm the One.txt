Justin Bieber (DJ Khaled)
Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth
The money never lie, no
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one
Early mornin' in the dawn
Know you wanna ride now (let's ride, let's ride)
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one, yeah

And you sick of all those other imitators
Don't let the only real one intimidate cha
See you watchin', don't run outta time now
I'm the one, yeah

Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh

Oh-eh-oh-oh-oh, eh-oh

Quavo
Yeah, yeah, Quavo
I'm the one that hit that same spot (hit it)
She the one that bring them rain drops (rain drops)
We go back, remember criss-cross and hopscotch? (hopscotch)
You the one that hold me down when the block's hot (hot)

I make your dreams come true when you wake up (dream)
And your look's just the same without no make-up
Had to pull up on your mama, see what you're made of (mama)
Ain't gotta worry 'bout them commas 'cause my cake up

You can run inside my life from that fame bus
'Cause I promise when we step out you'll be famous
Modern day Bonnie and Clyde what they named us
'Cause when we pull up (prr prr) all angles

Justin Bieber (DJ Khaled)
Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth

Chance
Okay, though
Uh, she beat her face up with that new Chanel
She like the price, she see the ice, it make her coochie melt
When I met her in the club I asked her who she felt
Then she went and put that booty on that Gucci belt, ha

We don't got no label
She say she want bottles, she ain't got no table
She don't got no bed frame, she don't got no tables
We just watchin' Netflix, she ain't got no cable, okay though

Plug, plug, plug, I'm the plug for her
She want a nigga that pull her hair and hold the door for her
Baby, that's only me, bitch, it okay with me
Baby, okay, okay though

Justin Bieber (DJ Khaled)
Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth

Li'l Wayne
Lookin' for the one? Well, bitch, you're lookin' at the one
I'm the best yet, and yet my best is yet to come
'Cause I've been lookin' for somebody
Not just any fuckin' body
Don't make me catch a body
That's for any and everybody

Oh my God! She hit me up all day, get no response
Bitch, you blow my high, that's like turnin' gold to bronze
Roll my eyes
And when she on the molly she a zombie
She think we Clyde and Bonnie
But it's more like Whitney / Bobby

God, forgive me
Tunechi F finessin', I'm a legend
Straight up out The Crescent
Fly your bae down for the Essence
For the record I knew Khaled when that boy was spinnin' records
Guilderberg gang winnin' record
I'm just flexin' on my exes, oh God

Justin Bieber (DJ Khaled)
Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth
The money never lie, no
