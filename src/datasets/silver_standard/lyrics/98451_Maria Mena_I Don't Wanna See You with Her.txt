It's a small town, word gets around
And travels in circles through hoops over hurdles
Everyone's careless
They talk about our mess
They don't care how it hurts me
Must think it was easy

They say you have a new love
I'm happy for you, love
I just don't wanna meet her
Are you gonna keep her?

'Cause I don't wanna see you with her
I don't wanna see her face
Resting in your embrace
Her feets standing in my place
I don't wanna see you moved on
I don't think that I'm that strong
It hasn't been that long
Since I was the one in your arms

I don't like being sober
That's when it hits me it's over
All though it was my choice
I can't shake your calm voice
Saying you found one that makes you feel as strong
And helps you through hard times
'Cause that job was once mine

They say you have a new love
I'm happy for you, love
I just don't wanna meet her
Are you gonna keep her?

'Cause I don't wanna see you with her
I don't wanna see her face
Resting in your embrace
Her feets standing in my place
Guess I don't wanna see you moved on
I don't think that I'm that strong
It hasn't been that long
Since I was the one in your arms
I don't wanna see you with her

I don't wanna see you with her
'Cause I don't wanna see you with her
I don't wanna see her face
Resting in your embrace
Her feets standing in my place
Oh, I don't wanna see you moved on
I don't think that I'm that strong
It hasn't been that long
Since I was the one in your arms
'Cause I don't wanna see you with her
