Lookin' back now, well it makes me laugh,
We were growin' our hair,
We were cuttin' class,
Knew it all already there was nothing to learn,
We were strikin' matches just to watch 'em burn.

Listen to our music just a little too loud,
We were hangin' in there with the outcast crowd,
Headin' to the rapids with some discount beer,
It was a long train trestle but we had no fear,

Man I don't know, where the time goes
But it sure goes fast, just like that,
We were wanna be rebels who didn't have a clue
In our rock 'n' roll t-shirts and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly
Young

Talked a good game, when we were out with the guys
But in the backseat we were awkward and shy,
Girls were a mystery that we couldn't explain,
And I guess there are some things that are never gonna change

Man I don't know where the time goes
But it sure goes fast, just like that
We were wannabe rebels that didn't have a clue
In our rock 'n' roll teeshirts and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly
Young
Young, young, Yeah and wishing we were older
Young, Hey I wish it wasn't over

Man I don't know, where the time goes,
But it sure goes fast, just like that
We were wanna be rebels that didn't have a clue
In our rock 'n' roll t-shirts and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly
Young

Young, Hey and wishing we were older
And I wish it wasn't over
