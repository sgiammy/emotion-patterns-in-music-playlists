We're rolling "Suicide"

Wake up (wake up)
Grab a brush and put on a little makeup
Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup (hide the scars to fade away the)
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
Here you go, create another fable

You wanted to
Grab a brush and put a little makeup
You wanted to
Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup
You wanted to
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
You wanted to

I don't think you trust
In my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die

Wake up (wake up)
Grab a brush and put on a little makeup
Hide the scars to fade away the (hide the scars to fade away the)
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
Here you go, create another fable

You wanted to
Grab a brush and put a little makeup
You wanted to
Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup

I don't think you trust
In my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die
In my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die

Father (father)
Father (father)
Father (father)
Father (father)
Father, into your hands I commit my spirit
Father, into your hands

Why have you forsaken me?
In your eyes forsaken me
In your thoughts forsaken me
In your heart forsaken me, oh

Trust in my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die
In my self-righteous suicide
I cry when angels deserve to die
