Well I met you at the blood bank
We were looking at the bags
Wondering if any of the colors
Matched any of the names we knew on the tags

You said "See look that's yours!
Stacked on top with your brother's
See how they resemble one another's
Even in their plastic little covers"

And I said I know it well

That secret that you know 
But you don't know how to tell
It fucks with your honor
And it teases your head
But you know that it's good girl
'Cause it's running you with red

Then the snow started falling
We were stuck out in your car
You were rubbing both my hands
Chewing on a candy bar

You said "Ain't this just like the present
To be showing up like this"
As a moon waned to crescent 
We started to kiss

And I said I know it well

That secret that we know
That we don't know how to tell
I'm in love with your honor
I'm in love with your cheeks
What's that noise up the stairs babe?
Is that Christmas morning creaks?

And I know it well 
I know it well
I know it well
I know it well
I know it well
I know it well
I know it well
I know it well
