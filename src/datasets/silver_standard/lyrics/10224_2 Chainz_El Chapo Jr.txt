I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr
El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr
Anywhere on the map, I bring it to you
El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, I'ma bring it to ya

I wear Versace like it's Nike, you don't like it do you
I bet you feel this bankroll if I bump into you, oh yeah
Chopper bullets flying errywhere, got them chopper bullets flying errywhere
.223 chopper clip as long as Stacey Augmon., in the restaurant I order 2 fried lobsters
Napkin on my Balmains, smokin' with lil mama
Like fuck your baby daddy, his daddy should've worn a condom
All these grams on me, all these bands on me
Make her want to dance on me and put her hands on me
Sprinter van on me, I got them Zans on me
Driveway so damn long by the time I leave I'm damn asleep

I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr
El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr
Anywhere on the map, I bring it to you
El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, I'ma bring it to ya

I done put so many on I can't fall off, trying to see how much the West End Mall costs
I might buy a Maybach and paint it all gold, buy a crib fill the rooms up with all stoves
I feel like I just paid off the plug, drop the top off the whip, hell I receive
High life nights so I woke up this evening, can't pimp me so don't you tip me
Rims on the car make it six feet, so I can park the car wherever the blimps be
I want a bird for my birthday, I drink syrup with no pancakes
Yeah, bitches round my pool, I make them hoe look like my landscape
Yeah, El Chapo J R R, multicolor A.R. rules
Looking like I play ball, tell 'em keep they day jobs

I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr
El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr
Anywhere on the map, I bring it to you
El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, I'ma bring it to ya
