How come all the pretty girls like you are taken, baby?
I've been looking for someone like you to save me
Life's too easy to be so damn complicated
Take your time and I'll be waitin'

Keep me in mind
Somewhere down the road you might get lonely
Keep me in mind
And I pray someday that you will love me only

I think about you some days
And the way I would lay wastin' day after day with you
We always go our separate ways
But no one can love you, baby, the way I do

Keep me in mind
Somewhere down the road you might get lonely
Keep me in mind
And I pray someday that you will love me only

Well the world can be real tough
Find shelter in me
If there's no one else to love
Keep me in mind

If ever you wanted me, I'll be your man
I'd be a fool to let you go with someone else
Whatever you want from me, I'll be your man
I'd give it all up just to have you for myself

Keep me in mind
Somewhere down the road you might get lonely
Keep me in mind
And I pray someday that you will love me only

Well, the world can be real tough
Won't you hold on to me
When there's no one else to love
Keep me in mind
(Keep me in mind)
And I'll hold you darling
(Keep me in mind)
I'll be your man
(Keep me in mind)
I'll hold you darling
(Keep me in mind)
C'mon little mama
Put it on me
