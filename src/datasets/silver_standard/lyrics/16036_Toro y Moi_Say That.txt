Tell me you won't ever give up
She owes my love, and I've got her now
She's all right, I'm all right
We're all right, we can't go back

Say that you'll always remind me
'Cause I can't decide if you are my love
I know I can always be home but
I never left, don't think like that

Tell me you won't ever give up
She owes my love, and I've got her now
She's all right, I'm all right
We're all right, we can't go back

Say that you'll always remind me
'Cause I can't decide if you are my love
I know I can always be home but
I never left, don't think like that

She's all right, I'm all right
We're all right, we can't go back
She's all right, I'm all right
We're all right, we can't go back

Say that you'll always remind me
'Cause I can't decide, if you are my love
I know I can always be home but
I never left, don't think like that

She's all right, I'm all right
We're all right, we can't go back

She's all right, I'm all right
We're all right, we can't go back

She's all right, I'm all right
We're all right, we can't go back
