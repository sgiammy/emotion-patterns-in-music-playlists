Down to Earth,
Keep on falling when I know it hurts
Going faster than a million miles an hour
Trying to catch my breath someway somehow
Down to Earth,
It's like I'm frozen but the world still turns
Stuck in motion and the wheels keep spinning round
Moving in reverse with no way out

And now I'm one step closer to being
Two steps far from you
When everybody wants you
Everybody wants you

How many nights does it take to count the stars?
That's the time it would take to fix my heart
Oh baby I was there for you, 
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah yeah
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?
Lie awake only hoping they're okay
I've never counted all of mine
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity, 
Infinity, infinity, yeah infinity

Eyes can't shine
Unless there's something burning bright behind
Since you went away, there's nothing left in mine
I feel myself running out of time

And now I'm one step closer to being
Two steps far from you
When everybody wants you
Everybody wants you

How many nights does it take to count the stars?
That's the time it would take to fix my heart
Oh baby I was there for you, 
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah yeah
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?
Lie awake only hoping they're okay
I've never counted all of mine
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity, 
Infinity, infinity, yeah infinity

Infinity, infinity

How many nights does it take to count the stars?
That's the time it would take to fix my heart
Oh baby I was there for you, 
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah yeah
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?
Lie awake only hoping they're okay
I've never counted all of mine
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity, 
Infinity, infinity, yeah

Infinity
