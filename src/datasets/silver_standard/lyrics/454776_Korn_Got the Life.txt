Hate, something, sometime, some way 
Something kicked down the front floor 
Mine? 
Something inside, I'll never ever follow
So give me something that is for real, I'll never, ever follow

Get your boogie on, get your boogie on

Hate, something, some way, each day
Feeling ripped off again now
Why? This shit inside
Now everyone will follow
So give me nothing, just feel, and all the shit will follow

God thinks we will never see the light
Who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life
Oh, I say
God thinks we will never see the light
Who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life
Oh, I say

Each day I can feel it swallow inside
Something torn from me, I don't feel your deathly ways
Each day I feel so hollow inside, always beating me
You'll never see, so come dance with me
Dance with me, dance with me
Dance with me, dance with me
Dance with me, dance with me
Me

God thinks we will never see the light
Who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life
Oh, I say
God thinks we will never see the light
Who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life

Got the life, got the life, got the life, got the life
Got the life, got the life, got the life, got the life
Got the life
