She doesn't own a dress
Her hair is always a mess
If you catch her stealin' she won't confess
She's beautiful

Smokes a pack a day
Oh, wait, that's me, but anyway
She doesn't care a thing about that, hey
She thinks I'm beautiful
Meet Virginia

She never compromises
Loves babies and surprises
Wears high heels when she exercises
Ain't that beautiful?
Meet Virginia

Well she wants to be the Queen
Then she thinks about her scene
Pulls her hair back as she screams
I don't really wanna be the queen

Her daddy wrestles alligators
Mama works on carburetors
Her brother is a fine mediator
For the President

Well here she is again on the phone
Just like me, hates to be alone
We just like to sit at home
And rip on the President
Meet Virginia

Well she wants to live her life
Then she thinks about her lies
Pulls her hair back as she screams
I don't really wanna live this life

She only drinks coffee at midnight
When the moment is not right
Her timing is quite, unusual
You see her confidence is tragic
But her intuition magic
And the shape of her body - unusual

Meet Virginia- I can't wait to
Meet Virginia- Yeah-ey eh eh eh eh

Well she wants to be the Queen
Then she thinks about her scene
Well she wants to live her life
Then she thinks about her lies
Pulls her hair back as she screams
I don't really wanna be the Queen
I don't really wanna be the Queen
I don't really wanna be the Queen
I don't really wanna live this
