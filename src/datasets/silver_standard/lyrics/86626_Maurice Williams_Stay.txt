Stay
Just a little bit longer
Please, please, please, please, please
Tell me you're going to

Now, your daddy don't mind
And your mommy don't mind
If we have another dance
Just one more
One more time

Oh, won't you stay
Just a little bit longer
Please let me hear
You say that you will

Won't you press your sweet lips
To mine
Won't you say you love me
All of the time

Stay
Just a little bit longer
Please, please, please, please, please
Tell me you're going to

Come on, come on
Come on and stay
