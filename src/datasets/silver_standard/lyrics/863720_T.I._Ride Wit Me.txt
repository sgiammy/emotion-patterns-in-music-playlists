Alone though? Shit, he just doin' what he known for
Blowin' dro on 24's, livin' how the song go
Rubber burnin,' turnin' corners, beatin' like a Congo

Hey I told you I'm an OG, never had cold feet
Ya end up with no teeth, nigga you don't know me
I knock you off ya feet, put holes in ya 'til ya clothes leak
Tossed this in the river like I threw away my old heat
You chose to oppose me, who the fuck you s'posed to be?
Mechanicsville and Summerhill and Zone 3 to roll with me
No hoes with me, you know all the blow these folk have sold with me?
I'm everything you s'posed to be, boy, ain't no runnin' over me
Kick it with the King and let me show you what I mean, man
Most these niggas rappin' bout a block ain't never seen 'em
Real niggas recognize real niggas, and ye ain't none
You don't know how to stab a nigga dead, keep a clean hand
Sell a block for 24 you got for 17 a gram
From East Side niggas in Kirkwood and Li'l Vietnam
These 26's keep the attention of bitches
Come and ride with me, pimpin,' let me show you how we get it
