Once I had a shotgun to my head they said I wasn't worth the bullets

Now the world is my trigger and I'm here to fucking pull it

Once I had a shotgun to my head they said I wasn't worth the bullets
Now the world is my trigger and I'm here to fucking pull it

Still here (still here!) I can't hesitate
Eyes wide open, pupils dilate
Still here (right here!) set to detonate

I see the swarm the scavengers await
No sleep

No rest
If that's what it takes to be the best

No sleep
No rest

Must stay driven I can't relent

Once had a knife to my throat they said I'd wind up in the dirt
I know the ones who doubt me are the ones that really hurt
Still here (still here!) I can't hesitate
Eyes wide open, pupils dilate

Still here (right here!) set to detonate
I see the swarm the scavengers await

No sleep
No rest
If that's what it takes to be the best

No sleep
No rest
Must stay driven I can't relent

Came from the gutter just missed the grave
Now I'm looking down the barrel of today
Start from nothing stop at nothing hell-bent
Never put myself in that position again
Now I'm looking down the barrel of today
Once I had a shotgun to my head they said I wasn't worth the bullets
Now the world is my trigger I'll fucking pull it
Once I had a shotgun to my head they said I wasn't worth the bullets
Now the world is my trigger I'm gonna fucking pull it
No sleep
No rest
Must do what it takes to be the best
No sleep
No rest
Do anything that it takes to be the best
