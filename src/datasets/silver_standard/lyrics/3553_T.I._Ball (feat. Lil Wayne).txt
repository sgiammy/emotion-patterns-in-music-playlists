Okay we walk off in this bitch, ballin' in this bitch
Hoppin' out of Lambos and Ferraris in this bitch
Poppin' bottles with a thick red supermodel bitch
They may talk a lot of that but they can't do a lot of this

Aye, Rico told me turn the lights on
So I grab the Audemar and threw the ice on
Imma big dawg, got 'em pissed off
A lot of niggas rapping, ain't none this raw

They like, aye look at T.I., ballin' in the V.I.
Bunch of bad bitches with a looking like Aaliyah
We just pull up, hop out, go in, show out
Buy the whole bar, pop bottles, go hard

This club so packed, these hoes so drunk
This club so packed, these hoes so drunk
This club so packed, these hoes so drunk
I got a bottle, got a model, got a molly, got a blunt

Ball, ball, ball, ball
Ball, ball, ball, ball
Ball, ball, ball, ball

I got a bottle, got a model, got a molly, got a blunt

The club full of bad bitches and they came to play
Okay, it must be your hair 'cause it ain't your face
Now if you looking for them bottles and them stacks girl
You make your way up to my section where it's at girl

Okay, do you wanna kick it with a nigga with a meal ticket?
Broke nigga looking mad, they just gotta deal with it
Get right hoe, roll a dice hoe
And ain't gotta be a dyke 'cause you like hoe

But every day I step behind a wall
I do it big, ride fly, stunt, shine, and ball
I got a bunch of money, so come and get it from me
And a bucket full of bottles, bust it open if you wanna get drunk

This club so packed, these hoes so drunk
This club so packed, these hoes so drunk
This club so packed, these hoes so drunk
I got a bottle, got a model, got a molly, got a blunt

Ball, ball, ball, ball
Ball, ball, ball, ball
Ball, ball, ball, ball

I got a bottle, got a model, got a molly, got a blunt

Ain't no nigga like a Young Money nigga
Pop that pussy like a gun, pull the trigger
Shake that ass like a salt shaker
I keep a L lit up like an elevator

Bitch shake it like a dog, hop like a frog, ride it like a horse
I throw that dick like darts
Drink all muddy, flag all bloody
I'm killin' these hoes like that nigga Ted Bundy

I'm a good looking rapper, I ain't tryna stunt
Imma fire my blunt like Donald Trump
Where you at, hoe? Where you at, hoe?
Can a nigga stick his key up in ya back door?
Tunechi

And do ya thing in slow motion like Soulja Slim
And come around, wipe me down like Boosie dem
That thang up for me, show me that you love me
If it's really too much for you, you can bring a couple buddies

Every day I do my thang, big stones and chains
She let me drill all in her mouth, no novacane
Them other broke niggas, all they did was told ya thangs
I could get ya on that G4 and show ya thangs

I like my women fat ass, pretty, toes, and thing
Long hair, don't care, as long as none down there
If it's manicured, I can have fun down there
Take you to whatever club, throw some money in the air

This club so packed, these hoes so drunk
This club so packed, these hoes so drunk
This club so packed, these hoes so drunk
