I don't wanna die too young
Yeah too young, yeah too young
I don't wana die too young
Too young, too young
Counting bands, hallelujah
'Lujah, 'lujah
I don't wanna die too young
Too young, too young
I've been grinding way too long
Too long, too long, too young

Came up, don't know
I just keep going with the flow
I just wanna go and cop me somethin'
I hit Fairfax, go shopping though
She just wanna hit that bathingroom
Hold that guap like a register
Keep on winning, need that guap though
Like a cash out, need a pop of those
Flowing on to the Galapagos
Running and grab the dough
Man this shit never minimum
Feel like an animal
Yeah bitch I try to keep me cool
Your life never going, never going back
Yeah, I don't wanna die too young
I don't wanna die too young
When I get that cash it's hallelujah

Aye hallelujah, aye hallelujah, aye hallelujah

I don't wanna die too young
Too young, too young

Counting bands, hallelujah
'Lujah, 'lujah
I don't wanna die too young
Too young, too young
I've been grinding way too long

Too long, too long
Way fast, my bitch bad
I skrrr skrr, that coupe fast

My coupe fast, your bitch know
My bitch slow, she do what I say so
And she always keep me on my toes
Poppin' that woe, man I be gone
Just watch me go
Bitches they watching me go
Walking around, aye I pick that band up
Then I go drop that shit off
Pull up in a Porsche, shit poppin' off
Pop that shit off, I got that bitch off
I tell her to knock that shit off
And I got my nut off and she washed my nuts off
I want that shit, I got that shit, pop that shit
Got rich quick, suck my...

You know it make me God damn numb
When I see 'em die I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die too young, too young, too young
Countin' bands hallelujah, 'lujah, 'lujah

Yeah I don't wana die too young, too young
I've been grindin way too long, too long, Too long, too young
(I don't wanna die too young
Too young, too young
Counting bands, hallelujah
'Lujah, 'lujah
I don't wanna die too young
Too young, too young)
