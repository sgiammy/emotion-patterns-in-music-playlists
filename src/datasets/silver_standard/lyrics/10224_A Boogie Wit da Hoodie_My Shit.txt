In my bag now, In my bag now
What the fuck is that sound, what the fuck is that sound

Brought the mac out
Niggas sat down
I got shit I never had now
I could brag now
Got my bitch a Louis bag now
She could brag now
Bought my bitch a Birkin bag now
She a brat now
Now I'm sitting in the club
In a different bag now
Baby when I pick it up
You gon put that ass down
Tell 'em you don't give a fuck
Baby spin that ass 'round
Tell the DJ turn it up
What the fuck is that sound
A boogie wit the hoodie and it's always foreign
Yeah I know she like my style them other niggas boring
When I pull up it go skrrt skrrt that's a foreign
When I pull up on a red light they don't want it
Yeah I came up from the mud and my baby know that
Introduced her to my plug now she think she all that
When I first hit her up, no she never wrote back
Then I saw her at the club so I got up on that

Now every time they play this song she say "this is my shit"
See the flick on my wrist
And I know she know wassup baby this is my shit
See the flick on my wrist

They know that's my bitch, that's a fact and she stuck with me
When you in my section fill it up when my cup empty
I can't fuck with rats, that's a fact, that's a dub nigga
All about my F can't put water over blood nigga
Trust me it get ugly
If I wasn't getting money would you still want me
If I told you I was broke would you start acting funny
This is all I ever wanted you can't take it from me

Now every time they play this song she say "this is my shit"
See the flick on my wrist
And I know she know wassup baby this is my shit
See the flick on my wrist
