All they know is they can kill anybody but Kells
I am untouchable, you would think I was in jail
But I'm in Mexico getting marijuana from Miguel.
Bring it back into the states, put in on the scale,
Measure out half an 8th put it in a shell.
Split it then I roll it then light it up like it's Independence Day.
I got a bottle rocket put it in the air
Snapback with my city on it, text back with your titties on it.
Levi's put your kitty on it, start Grindin' like the Clipse is on it.
Drank until I get pissy bitch, smoke until I get dizzy bitch
Lose control like Missy, but I'm a bad boy 'cause I'm with Diddy biiiiiitch
