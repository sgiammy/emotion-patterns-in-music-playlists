She'll lie and steal and cheat
And beg you from her knees
Make you thinks she means it this time
She'll tear a hole in you
The one you can't repair
But I still love her, I don't really care

When we were young, oh oh, we did enough
When it got cold, ooh ooh, we bundled up
I can't be told, ah ah it can't be done

It's better to feel pain
Than nothing at all
The opposite of love's indifference
So pay attention now
I'm standing on your porch screaming out
And I won't leave until you come downstairs

So keep your head up, keep your love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, keep your love

And I don't blame ya dear
For running like you did, all these years
I would do the same, your best believe
And the highway signs say we're close
But I don't read those things anymore
I never trusted my own eyes

When we were young oh oh, we did enough
When it got cold, ooh ooh we bundled up
I can't be told, ah ah, can't be done

So keep your head up, keep your love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, keep your love
Head up, love
Head up, love
Head up, love
Head up, love
