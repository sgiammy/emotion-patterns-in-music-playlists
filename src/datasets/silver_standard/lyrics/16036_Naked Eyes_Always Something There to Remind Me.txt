I walk along the city streets you used to walk along with me
And every step I take reminds me of just how
We used to be

Well, how can I forget you girl
When there is always something there to remind me?
Always something there to remind me

As shadows fall, I pass a small cafe where we would dance at night
And I can't help recalling
How it felt to kiss and hold you tight

Well, how can I forget you girl
When there is always something there to remind me?
Always something there to remind me

I was born to love her
And I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me
Oh whoa whoa whoa

If you should find you miss the sweet and tender love we used to share
Just come back to the places where we used to go
And I'll be there

Well, how can I forget you girl
When there is always something there to remind me?
Always something there to remind me

I was born to love her 
And I will never be free
You'll always be a part of me

'Cause there is always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me

Always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me

Always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
Always something there to remind me
