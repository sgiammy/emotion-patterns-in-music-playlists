Rachel:
Don't know much about your life
Don't know much about your world
But, don't want to be alone tonight
On this planet they call earth

You don't know about my past
And, I don't have a future figured out
And maybe this is going too fast
And maybe it's not meant to last

But what do you say to taking chances?
What do you say to jumping off the edge?
Never knowing if there's solid ground below
Or a hand to hold, or hell to pay
What do you say?
What do you say?

I just want to start again (I just want to start again)
Maybe you could show me how to try
Maybe you could take me in (Maybe you could take me in)
Somewhere underneath your skin

What do you say to taking chances?
What do you say to jumping off the edge?
Never knowing if there's solid ground below
Or a hand to hold, or hell to pay
What do you say?
What do you say?

And I had my heart beaten down
But I always come back for more, yeah
There's nothing like love to pull you up
When you're laying down on the floor there
So talk to me, talk to me
Like lovers do
Yeah, walk with me, walk with me
Like lovers do
Like lovers do

What do you say to taking chances?
What do you say to jumping off the edge?
Never knowing if there's solid ground below
Or a hand to hold, or hell to pay
What do you say?
What do you say?

Don't know much about your life
Don't know much about your world
