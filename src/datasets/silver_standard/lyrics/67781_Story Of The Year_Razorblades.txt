Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Walking example of you
Just wait for the silence
Talking backwards to you
It meant nothing to me

Watching the world fall on you
I'm keeping my eyes closed
Now I can see what this means to you
It meant nothing to me

This wasted so many nights and again
I've wasted so much time on a friend
Too young, too proud to understand
So this is the end

Perfect timing for you
(You'll run 'til your legs break)
So here's my reminder of you
It meant nothing to me

This wasted so many nights and again
I've wasted so much time on a friend
Too young, too proud to understand
So this is the end (Go)

We should've seen this coming
We should've seen this

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

This wasted so many nights and again
I've wasted so much time on a friend
Too young, too proud to understand
So this is the end

This wasted so many nights and again
I've wasted so much time on a friend
Too young, too proud to understand
So this is the end

Yeah, this is the end
