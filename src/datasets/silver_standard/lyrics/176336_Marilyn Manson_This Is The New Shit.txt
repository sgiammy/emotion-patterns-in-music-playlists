Babble, babble, bitch, bitch
Rebel, rebel, party, party
Sex, sex, sex and don't forget the violence
Blah, blah, blah, got your lovey-dovey, sad-and-lonely
Stick your stupid slogan in
Everybody sing along
Babble, babble, bitch, bitch
Rebel, rebel, party, party
Sex, sex, sex and don't forget the violence
Blah, blah, blah, got your lovey-dovey, sad-and-lonely
Stick your stupid slogan in
Everybody sing

Do we want it? "Yeah!"
This is the new shit
Stand up and admit

Babble, babble, bitch, bitch

Stick your stupid slogan in
