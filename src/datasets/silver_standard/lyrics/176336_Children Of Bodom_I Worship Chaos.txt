No peace of mind from quietude
Haunting nightmares follow through
The panic that lingers in my eye
Till I rip shit up, make angels cry
Comfort the silence sighing faintly
My dark twisted secrets gravely

Every night's the same
The world is sleeping
Yet my demons keep my creepin'
Through the cracks of my shattered mind
So I stir up the chaos one more time
Mayhem, wrath I claim thee mine
And both the sun and moon will shine

End of times
Just kill the quietude
Hear my cries
And start the countdown
Bury my crimes
Somewhere deep within
It's not that complicated
Simply I just worship chaos

Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

Turmoil, terror I now conjure
The hell in my head please do conquer
So I throw down kickin' and screaming
Lie flat on the ground discarded and bleedin'
But the noise is gone and that's why
I stir up the chaos one more time

End of times
Just kill the quietude
Hear my cries
And start the countdown
Bury my crimes
Somewhere deep within
It's not that complicated
Simply I just worship chaos
