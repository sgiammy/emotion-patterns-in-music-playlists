Know I walk with the racks on me
Bad bitch want back back
And you know she throw that ass on me
I don't want that girl 'cause
She want me 'cause the cash on me
Yeah, you know she cappin' homie
Dreadlock that cap on me

Back then they all napped on me
Now they all just act homie
Now I'm hot they all on me
Pull up Snapchats on me
I ain't got no Snapchat homie
I think it's too personal
That's what I got Twitter for
Instagram I back it up

Back then they all napped on me
Now they all just act homie
Now I'm hot they all on me
Pull up Snapchats on me
I ain't got no Snapchat homie

Like, flex on you haters, huh (hi haters)
This is my world so it's all in my favor
I like all girls, yeah all type of flavors
But that don't matter, 'cause I just got my baby (sike)
Pull her, right there Mercedes
Water water like the Navy
Fuck that girl till the sun down
Number one like I'm McGrady
Boy you said that you made me
Go ahead make another one
Do what I want 'cause I'm trusting none
I'm a love her, till the love is done
Took your girl, she ain't try to run
Hit from the back, so her legs get numb
Hit from the back so long, that my own legs starting to get numb
Suckin' me up, give me brain now she dumb
Tell her it's repercussions
Play her just like a drum
Make in a night what you make in a month

Back then they all napped on me
Now they all just act homie
Now I'm hot they all on me
Pull up Snapchats on me
