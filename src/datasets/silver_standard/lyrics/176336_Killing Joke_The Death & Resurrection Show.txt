Mark out the points
Build the pyre
Assemble different drummers
Light up the fire

Put on your masks
And animal skins
Illumination
Illumination

I listen to the drums
Between each beat
Each beat of the drum
O beloved mother of liberty
Hold me in your arms

Burn burn, burn brightly
Burn burn, burn white heat
Burn burn, burn brightly
Burn burn, burn white heat

And the day will come
Before the lights go out
Who will you turn to?
Who will you turn to?

Choose the crucifixion
Or Osiris slain
Recurring themes
Time again

Illumination
Illumination
Burn burn, burn brightly
Burn burn, burn white heat

Oh how ingenious, the centuries of lies
Ezekiel's chariots streak across the skies
Holy books and history texts
Forget because we know
Souls are recycled in
The death and resurrection show

O beloved woman of liberty
Come to me

Everything I'm taught
Amounts to naught
Everything I learn
The fire shall burn

Notions of myself
That I'm not
Whoever I was
Is now lost

Illumination
Illumination
Burn burn, burn brightly
Burn burn, burn white heat

Oh how ingenious, the centuries of lies
Ezekiel's chariots streak across the skies
Holy books and history texts
Forget because we know
Souls are recycled in
The death and resurrection show

O beloved woman of liberty
Come to me
Burn away all my impurities
Hold me in your arms

Burn burn, burn brightly
Burn burn, burn white heat
Burn burn, burn brightly
Burn burn, burn white heat

Oh how ingenious, the centuries of lies
Ezekiel's chariots streak across the skies
Holy books and history texts
Forget because we know
Souls are recycled in
The death and resurrection show

O beloved woman of liberty
Hold me in your arms
