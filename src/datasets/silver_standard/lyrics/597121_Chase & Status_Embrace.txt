When the daylight weighs a tonne
And all my friends are gone
There's rust around the things I love
When it's fraying at the seams
Of reality and dreams
All those dreams are quiet and dull

This town's alright
But it's not enough
I'm looking for a quick exit
Like a prisoner on the run

This town's alright
But it's not enough
I'm looking for a quick exit
Like a prisoner on the run

Big time break down
Look how the stars come out
Big time break down
Why didn't you just shout?

I'm lonely and I'm looking
For a place to go
Where everything's an embrace
And everybody wants to know

I'm your absent Valentine
I'm the pigtails in the bride
I'm the still that carves the toes in your bottle
I'm the lynch mob in the dark
I'm the silk worm in your heart
Spinning out my perfect circle

This town's alright
But it's not enough
I'm looking for a quick exit
Like a prisoner on the run

This town's alright
But it's not enough
I'm looking for a quick exit
Like a prisoner on the run

Big time break down
Look how the stars come out
Big time break down
Why didn't you just shout?

I'm lonely and I'm looking
For a place to go
Where everything's an embrace
And everybody wants to know

Come on the water
Fetch your brother
Fetch your daughter
Come, come undone
Fetch your sister
Fetch your son

(Come on the water)
This town's alright
(Fetch your brother)
(Fetch your daughter)
But it's not enough
I'm looking for a quick exit
(Come, come undone)
Like a prisoner on the run
(Fetch your sister)
(Fetch your son)

(Come on the water)
This town's alright
(Fetch your brother)
(Fetch your daughter)
But it's not enough
I'm looking for a quick exit
(Come, come undone)
Like a prisoner on the run
(Fetch your sister)
(Fetch your son)

Big time break down
Look how the stars come out
Big time break down
Why didn't you just shout?

I'm lonely and I'm looking
For a place to go
Where everything's an embrace
And everybody wants to know

I'm lonely and I'm looking
For a place to go
Where everything's an embrace
And everybody wants to know
