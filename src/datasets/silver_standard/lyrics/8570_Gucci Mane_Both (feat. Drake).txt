If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

I got so many felonies
I might can't never go to Canada
But Drake said he gon' pull some strings
So let me check my calendar
I just popped me one of them one what-you-call-its
And it boosted my stamina
Now I'm fucking her on the banister
Guess I just East Atlanta'd her
I'm in an all red drop tarantula
Fuck a Challenger
Damn these hoes ain't got no manners bruh
Where's the manager?
I keep throwing rubber bandies up
Hoe, pull your panties up
'Cause you fuck like a granny fuck
You're just an amateur
This Patek Philipe gon' make this crooked judge
Try throw the book at me
I look like half a million worth of heroin
When she look at me
But you ain't gotta fuck with me my nig
But you're stuck with me
But how you called the cops on me my nig?
You grew up with me

I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now

Yeah, I'm both
Yeah, I had a drink, yeah, I smoked
Yeah, you think I need you, but I don't
Just left out Dubai with all my folk
Open water, my location is remote
Shout out Yachty but this ain't a Lil Boat
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get leftovers out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
Till I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean

I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
