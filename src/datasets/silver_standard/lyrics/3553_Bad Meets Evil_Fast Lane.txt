Royce Da 5'9":
(Uh)
First verse, uh, I'm on till I'm on a island
My life's ridin' on the Autobahn on autopilot
Before I touch dirt, I'll kill you all with kindness
I kill ya, my natural persona's much worse

You've been warned if you've been born or if you conform
Slap up a cop and then snatch him out of his uniform
Leave him wit' his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn

Y'all niggas' intellect mad slow, y'all fags know
Claimin' you bangin', you flamin', bet you could light your own cigarette wit' ya asshole
Me and Shady deaded the past so that basically resurrected my cash flow
I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke, though I ain't wrapped tight

My blood type's the '80s
My '90s was like the Navy
You was like the Bradys
You still fly kites daily

Eminem:
Catch me in my Mercedes, bumpin' "Ice, Ice Baby," screamin' Shady till I die
Like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy so I live it to the fullest till I'm Swayze
And you only live it once, so I'm thinkin' 'bout this nice, nice lady
Wait, no, stop me now b'fore I get on a roll (Danish)

Let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is, 'cause she's kinda famous
And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this
Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus
You morons think that I'm a genius

Really I belong inside a dang insane asylum, cleanin', try them trailer parks
Crazy, I am back, and I am razor-sharp, baby
And that's back wit' a capital B wit' an exclamation mark, maybe
You should listen when I flip the linguistics, 'cause I'm 'onna rip this mystical slick shit

You don't wanna become another victim or statistic of this shit
'Cause after I spit the bullets
I'ma treat these shell casings like a soccer ball I'ma kick the ballistics
So get this dick, I'ma live this

Sly "Pyper" Jordan:
Livin' life in the fast lane
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now

I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride
Just gon' roll till I drop and ride till I die
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal)
Livin' life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal)

Royce Da 5'9":
My whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit
At war wit' a bottle, this Captain Morgan attacks my organs
My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins
I made a pact with the Devil that says "I'll let you take me

You let me take this shovel, dig up the corpe's of Jack Kevorkian"
Go back and forth in more beef that you can pack a fork in
I'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy down, my tenement, too many now, to send my serenity powers
Spin 'em around, enterin' in the vicinity

Eminem:
Now, was called Eminem, but he threw away the candy and ate the rapper
Chewed him up (Pt!) and spitted him out
Girl, giddy-up, now get get down
He's lookin' around this club and it looks like people are havin' a shit fit-fit now

Here, little t-t-trailer trash, take a look who's back in t-t-town
Did I st-st-stutter, motherfucker, fuck the mall, he's just
A whole motherfuckin' Walmart d-d-down every time he comes a-r-r-round
And he came to the club tonight wit' 5'9" to hold this bitch down

Like a motherfuckin' chick underwater, he tryna d-dr-drown, shawty when you dance you got me captivated
Just by the way that you keep lickin' them dicks like lips, I'm agitated, aggravated
To the point you don't suck my dick, then you're gonna get decapitated
Other words, you don't fuckin' give me head, then I'm have to take it

Royce Da 5'9":
And then after takin' that, I'ma catch a case, it's gon' be fascinatin'
It's gonna say "The whole rap game passed away" on top of the affidavit
Graduated from master debater slash massive masturbator to Michael Jackson' activator (Woo)
Meanin' I'm on fire off the top, might wanna back up the data

Runnin' over hip-hop in a verbal tractor-trailer
Homey, this sick, you can normally ask a hater
Don't it make sense, these shell casings is just like a bag of paper
Drop in the lap of a tax evader (Homie, they spent)

Eminem:
Now make that ass drop, like a sack of potatoes, what girl I'm the crack-a-lator
Percolator this party, be my penis ejaculator later
Tell you boyfriend that you just struck paydirt
You rollin' wit' a player, you won't be exaggeratin' when you say you're livin'

Sly "Pyper" Jordan:
Livin' life in the fast lane
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now

I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin' the ride
Just gon' roll till I drop and ride till I die
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal)
Living life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal)
