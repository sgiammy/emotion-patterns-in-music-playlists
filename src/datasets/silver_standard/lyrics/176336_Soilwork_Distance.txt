Can you please remind me where the fuck I've been?
'Cause I can't find it out, you see
So return me to a vital place
From a distant observation
Corrosion of emotions
Is how you block your state

From scratch to revelation
It's all been there
Bleeding for someone to dare
Extension of deceptions
Brings you to your final collapse

Am I really an exception?

Is that your only entertainment? (spoiling your desire)
To blow your minds on a one way track
From a distance

Building knowledge out of flexible existence
Hunt for adrenaline
Is staggering
Grand lack of emotions
You'll never face conclusions
You will get what you want

Am I really an exception?

Is that your only entertainment? (spoiling your desire)
To blow your minds on a one way track
I tell you a lie and you make it a statement (sleeping in denial)
You're all wasting the time of your lives

Cold and crawling
You made it back
Fear is selling and you're one with the fact
Counting the days for rebirth
Lost once again and now it hurts

Is that your only entertainment? (spoiling your desire)
To blow your minds on a one way track
I tell you a lie and you make it a statement (sleeping in denial)
You're all having the time of your lives

(You're wasting) Is that your only entertainment? (you're wasting)
(You're wasting) To blow your minds on a one way track (you're wasting)
(You're wasting) I tell you a lie and you make it a statement (you're wasting)
You're all wasting the time of your lives
