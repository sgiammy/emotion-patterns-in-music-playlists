Antidote

There's no antidote

Don't stop, turn that up, take it higher
Tear this mother up, start a riot
Don't stop, turn that up, take it higher
Tear this mother up, start a riot

There's a glitch inside my system
Pushing through my whole existence
Got me twisted, can't resist this
Something's flipping all my switches
Take 'em, break 'em, make 'em feel it
Mix it up and mass appeal it
Pressure is riding me hard
Killer dose right through my heart

And there's no antidote
And there's no antidote
And there's no antidote
(Antidote, antidote, antidote)
And there's no antidote

There's no antidote

There's no antidote

There's no antidote
