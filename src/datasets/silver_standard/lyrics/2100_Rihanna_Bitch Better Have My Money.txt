Bitch better have my money!
Y'all should know me well enough
Bitch better have my money!

Louis XIII and it's all on me, nigga you just bought a shot
Kamikaze if you think that you gon' knock me off the top
Shit, your wife in the backseat of my brand new foreign car
Don't act like you forgot, I call the shots, shots, shots
Like brrap, brrap, brrap
Pay me what you owe me, don't act like you forgot

Bitch better have my money!

Turn up to Rihanna while the whole club fuckin' wasted
Every time I drive by, I'm the only thing you're playin'
In a drop top, doin' hundred, y'all in my rearview mirror racin'
Where y'all at? Where y'all at? Where y'all at?
Like brrap, brrap, brrap

Louis XIII and it's all on me, nigga you just bought a shot
