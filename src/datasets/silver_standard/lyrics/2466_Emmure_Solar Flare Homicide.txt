I see a fire in the sky

Lights go out
I'm gonna finish what I started
Lights go out
And now you better pray
I don't know where you are

Do you remember

Do you remember just like I always do?
I've been trying to remind you
Do you remember just like I always do?
I've been trying to remind you

There ain't gonna be a jail sentence
No more Fucking Consequence
There ain't gonna be a jail sentence
No more Fucking Consequence
No!

No there will never be another sentence

I see a fire in the sky
Lights go out
I'm gonna finish what I've started
Lights go out
And now you better pray I don't know where you are
Lights go out
I'm gonna finish what I've started
Lights go out
And now you better pray I don't know where you are

Fire in the sky
This is freedom
(I see fire in the sky)
Now you'll suffer
(I see fire in the sky)
This is freedom
(I see fire in the sky)
Now you'll suffer

I see a fire in the sky
Lights go out
I'm gonna finish what I've started
Lights go out
And now you better pray I don't know where you are
Lights go out
I'm gonna finish what I've started
Lights go out
And now you better pray I don't know where you are
