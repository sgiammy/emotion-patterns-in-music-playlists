Hey Shawty what it do, what's happenin' ?
Peep the way you move I can tell you make it happen
I see you walking around like your feet don't hurt
Shawty just cold like the heat don't work
She independent, you be ballin' on the budget
She ridin' in the fly's all the real niggas love it
Money making mission she just steady chasin' duckets
Shawty, she ain't playin' she just ballin', Denver Nugget

G5 fly, lord oh ma
Can't help to stare, every time you walk by
You got thang for a nigga I can see it in your eye
What I gotta do for a piece of a pie

I ain't worried too much bout Shawty, no
'Cause I know that she be workin'
In the spare time Shawty just countin' dough
We all know she's important
Let me know if you gon' ride with a fella
Me and you together super fly like propellers
I love to her hold her bag and I told her about whatever
Get it while's good 'cause nothing last forever

G5 fly, lord oh ma

When I get the chance I'mma fuck you like I own it
Feel good comin' from a real nigga, don't it

Baby, just be comfortable
