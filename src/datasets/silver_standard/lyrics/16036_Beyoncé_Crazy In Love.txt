Yes
It's so crazy right now
Most incredibly, it's your girl, B
It's your boy, Young

You ready?

Get up, history in the making
Part two, it's so crazy right now

I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row

Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love you're doing no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now (in love)
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss
Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love's
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love

No no
No no
No no
No no

When I talk to my friends so quietly
Who he think he is? Look at what you did to me
They assure me, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress

The way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how the love you're doing no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now (in love)
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss
Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love's
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love
I'm looking so crazy in love's
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love

'Jay-Z'
Check it, let's go
Young Hov y'all know when the flow is loco
Young B and the R-O-C, uh oh
Ol' G, big homie, the one and only
Stick bony, but the pocket is fat like Tony

Soprano, The ROC handle like Van Exel
I shake phoneys man, you can't get next to
The genuine article, I do not sing though
I sling dough, If anything I bling yo

A star like Ringo, war like a green beret
You crazy? Bring ya whole set
Jay-Z in the range, crazy and deranged
They can't figure 'I'm out they like hey is he insane

Yes sir I'm cut from a different cloth
My texture is the best fur, chinchilla
(No no)
Been dealing with chain smokers
But how you think I got the name Hova?
(No no)
I been realer the game's over
(No no)
Fall back young, ever since the label changed over
(No no)
To platinum the game's been wrap, one

Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself, lately I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby I don't care
'Cause your love's got the best of me
And baby you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
'Cause baby you got me, you got me, you got me so crazy baby
Hey

Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now (in love)
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch

Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love's
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love

Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now (in love)
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now (your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss
