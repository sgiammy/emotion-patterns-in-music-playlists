If your chick come close to me

Ooh the hoes go for me

That's how it post to be

Everything good like it post to be

Pull up to the club and it go up
Make your girl fall in love when I show up
It's not my fault she want to know me
She told me you was just a homie

She came down like she knew me
Gave it up like a groupie
And that's facts, no printer
Cold nigga turn the summer to the winter

But I had her screaming oh
