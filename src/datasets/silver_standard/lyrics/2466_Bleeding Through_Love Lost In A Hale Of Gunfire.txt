This was a fucking bomb
For a few seconds, this place was Armageddon
There was a firefight

You are the fucking disease
Another day, another memory
But I have fucking failed
I turned another lie into the work of a saint

So where is the cure?
Hundreds of souls
With the look of horror on their face
Now I rise from my knees
I will not live in misery
You won't take me
You won't take me
Now it's me
Now it's me

All that's left is a bitter taste of a life that was once so promising
Rather cut at the wrist than laugh about your mistakes
Sickness still fills the air
Another life that you wish you could fake
Your eyes will cut through me, but it's a risk, that I must fucking take
I must take

So where is the cure?
Hundreds of souls
With the look of horror on their face
Now I rise from my knees
I will not live in misery
You won't take me
You will not destroy me
You cannot destroy me

And I'll fight you with every ounce of strength I have left
And I'll seal it with a bullet and a kiss
So look at your fucking horror
Horror
I want to see your face
Show me your true face
I want to see your face
Show me your true face

My heart belongs to you, so save me
My heart belongs to you, so save me, for the sake to give it away
Still beats (Still beats)
Still beats (Still beats)
Still beats inside of me
My heart belongs to you, so save me
And my heart still beats
And my heart still beats
My heart still beats, so save me
My heart still beats
