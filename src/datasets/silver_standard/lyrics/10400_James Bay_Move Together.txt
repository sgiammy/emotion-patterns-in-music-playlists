Home now, end of the night
It's colder to turn on your side
And I know you're up in two hours
We didn't get tonight, we don't have tomorrow
So don't ruin now.

How we gonna move together? Just come closer
If we don't move together, just come closer
How we gonna breathe? How we gonna be together?
Just keeping the peace between the sheets

And I creep in, everything's loud
I'm sorry for walking you now
And we argue the tiniest thing
We didn't get tonight, we don't have tomorrow
So I'm done whispering, done whispering.

How we gonna move together? Just come closer
If we don't move together, just come closer
How we gonna breathe? How we gonna be together?
Just keeping the peace between the sheets.

So maybe don't give me cold shoulder
Before you go turn around, let me hold you
Let me sit in the dark of the morning
Yeah, it's more one thing now

How we gonna move together? Just come closer
If we don't move together, come closer
How we gonna breathe? How we gonna be together?
Just keeping the peace, just keeping the peace
Just keeping the peace between these sheets.
