Okay, it's Childish Gambino, homegirl drop it like the NASDAQ
Move white girls like there's coke up my ass crack
Move black girls 'cause man fuck it, I'll do either
I love pussy, I love bitches, dude, I should be runnin' PETA

In Adidas with some short shorts, B-O-O all over me
My green is where it's supposed to be, your green is in my grocery
This Asian dude, I stole his girl, and now he got that Kogi beef
My dick is like an accent mark, it's all about the over E's

Hot like a parked car
I sound weird like 'nigga' with a hard R
Fly like the logo on my cousin's 440
Eatin' Oreos like these white girls that blow me

Vodka for my ladies, whiskey for a grown man
Hangin' in the islands, lookin' for Earl like ToeJam
I made the beat retarded, so I'm callin' it a slow jam
Butcher and I know it, man - kill beef, go ham

These rappers are afraid of him
'Cause I'm a beast, bitch, GIR, Invader Zim
"Gambino is a call girl" - fuck you, pay me
Brand new whip for these niggas like slavery

Told me I was awful and that shit did not phase me
Tell me how I suck again, my memory is hazy
"You're my favorite rapper now" Yeah, dude, I better be
Or you can fuckin' kiss my ass - Human Centipede

You wanna see my girl? I ain't that dumb
You wanna see my girl? Check Maxim
Man, why does every black actor gotta rap some?
I don't know, all I know is I'm the best one

It's a bonfire, turn the lights out
I'm burnin' everything you muthafuckas talk about
It's a bonfire, turn the lights out (hu huh)
I'm burnin' everything you muthafuckas talk about

You know these rapper dudes, talk shit, start killin'
Fuck that, got goons like an arch villain
I'm from the south, ain't got no accent, don't know why
So this rap is child's play, I do my name like Princess Di

Yeah, they say they want the realness, rapped about my real life
Told me I should just quit: "First of all, you talk white.
Second off, you talk like you haven't given up yet"
Rap's stepfather, yeah you hate me but you will respect

I put in work, ask Ludwig
Put my soul on the track like shoes did
Played this for my cousin, now he can't even think straight
Black and white music? Now nigga that's a mixtape!

Shout out to my blerds, they represent the realness
Shout out to Gambino Girls, my dick is in the building
I know you hate me 'cause your little cousin play me out
I like black girls who nerdy but when they dance they be sayin' "Oww!"

I'm sorry for who followed me
Chillin' with a Filipina, at your local Jollibee
Yeah, I'm in her ass like sodomy
So if you see my hand under the table, don't bother me

I don't talk soft, that's that other guy
I'm screamin' "What the fuck is up?" like I ain't seen the sky
The shit I'm doin' this year? Insanity
Made the beat then murdered it - Casey Anthony

These rappers won't know what to do
'Cause all I did was act me like a Looney Tune
And I'll give you all of me until there's nothing left
I swear this summer will be summer camp, bitch
