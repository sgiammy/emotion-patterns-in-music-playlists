Some kind of evidence
Some kind of reason
Why I can't find a way
To be in my life

Somewhere in this dying day
If I could only find a way for my escape
I find it hard to concentrate with all my past mistakes

To be in my life

I can't feel my faith
Can't recall my crime
I think I sealed my fate
Along the way I may have lost my mind
I guess we're all damaged in our own way
Alone in our own way
Distant headlights
Desolate highway

I can't feel my faith
Can't recall my crime
I think I sealed my fate
Along the way I may have lost my mind
I guess we're all damaged in our own way
Alone in our own way
Distant headlights
Desolate highway

Sun doesn't rise at all
Who knows how far I'll fall
Sun doesn't rise at all
Who knows how far I'll fall

With eyes wide open
(Can't recall my crime
I think I sealed my fate)
I can watch my world evolve
(Alone in our own way
I think I sealed my fate)
Nothing left to die for
(Can't recall my crime
I think I sealed my fate)
Thoughts inside can make me crawl
(I think I sealed my fate)
Make me drop down on my knees
Break me down until I question me
Darkness can't destroy my drive

Sun doesn't rise at all
Who knows how far I'll fall
Sun doesn't rise at all
Welcome my downfall

Sun doesn't rise at all

Somewhere in this dying day
As I plan my great escape
I find it hard to concentrate
While you maintain control
I fold and falter empty altar
All I gave I pray it makes me whole
I think the brinks around the corner
And there's an error in my soul

I can't feel my faith
Can't recall my crime
I think I sealed my fate
Along the way I may have lost my mind
I guess we're all damaged in our own way
Alone in our own way
Distant headlights
Desolate highway

Sun doesn't rise at all
Who knows how far I'll fall
Sun doesn't rise at all
Who knows how far I'll fall

I can't feel my faith
Can't recall my crime
Damaged in our own way
Alone in our own way
Desolate highway
