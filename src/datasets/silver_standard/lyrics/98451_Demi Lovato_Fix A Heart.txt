It's probably what's best for you, I only want the best for you
And if I'm not the best then you're stuck
I tried to server ties and I, ended up with wounds to bind
Like you're pouring salt in my cuts

I just ran out of band-aids
I don't even know where to start
'Cause you can bandage the damage
You never really can fix a heart

Even though I know what's wrong, how could I be so sure
If you never say what you feel, feel
I must have held your hand so tight, you didn't have the will to fight
I guess you needed more time to heal

Baby I just ran out of band-aids
I don't even know where to start
'Cause you can bandage the damage
You never really can fix a heart

Ooh, Ooh, oh, whoa, oh, oh yeah
Ooh, Ooh, oh, whoa, oh, oh yeah

You must be a miracle worker
Swearin' up and down you can fix what's been broken yeah
Please don't give my hopes up, no, no
Baby tell me how could you be so cruel

It's like you're pouring salt on my cuts

Baby I just ran out of band-aids
I don't even know where to start
'Cause you can bandage the damage
You never really can fix a heart

Baby I just ran out of band-aids
I don't even know where to start
'Cause you can bandage the damage
You never really can fix a heart

Oh no, no, no
You never really can fix a heart
Oh no, no, no
You never really can fix heart

You never really can fix my heart
