I am an enemy of everything
my life is not for sale
my heart is in this fight forever
What can you take from me...
When there's not a single fucking day i haven't fought to stay alive? 

I'm finding hope in the hopeless
I am still their voice
that gets stuck in your head

I am me 
and I’ve come to fucking scare you to death
Because that's what you deserve, you disgusting piece of shit. 

I know the only words that you have for me, are “give up and get out”.
you'd like to think that we've been beaten but we're here to stay. forever and always

every single day not giving up,  living up all my dreams
so go ahead and look like i'm inferior.  
condescension, suffering, callousness and loathing
are the badges i have earned for my cause 

and I am finding hope within hatred
a reason to persist  / to push past everything 
We are here
and we have come to scare you to death 
Because thats what you deserve you fucking fake ass hypocrites.

I know the only words that you have for me, are “give up and get out”.
you'd like to think that we've been beaten but we're here to stay. forever and always
so loud, we are the ones that you pushed away, we're drowning your voice out 
you'd like to think we've been defeated, but we're here to stay forever and always. 

We've been through everything  
and we all have our scars   
We may be broken 
BUT YOU CAN"T KILL ALL OF US 

I am no villain, think before you fucking speak
People fear what they don't understand
And so now beauty has become the fucking beast 
maybe you didn’t hear me, i said go fuck yourself
