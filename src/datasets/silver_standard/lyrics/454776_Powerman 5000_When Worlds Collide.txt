What is it really that's goin' on here?
You've got the system for total control
Now is there anybody out there?
Now watch us suffer, yeah, 'cause we can't go

What is it really that is in your head?
What little life that you had just died?
I'm gonna be the one that's takin' over
Now this is what it's like when worlds collide

Are you ready to go?
'Cause I'm ready to go
What you gonna do baby, baby?
Are you goin' with me?
'Cause I'm goin' with you
That's the end of all time

What is it really that motivates you?
The need to fly or this fear to stop?
I'll go along, but then you'll realize
When we get there, I say nine of ten drop

Now who's the light and who is the devil?
You can't decide, so I'll be your guide
And one by one, they will be hand-chosen
Now this is what it's like when worlds collide

Are you ready to go?
'Cause I'm ready to go
What you gonna do baby, baby?
Are you goin' with me?
'Cause I'm goin' with you
That's the end of all time

What you gonna do baby, baby?
Are you goin' with me?
