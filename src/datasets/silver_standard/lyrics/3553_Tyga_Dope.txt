T-raw rock my own kick game
8 figure deal figure how I'm courtside at clip game
Still pop ace king shit I'm with rozay
Black Maybach leather gloves on that OJ

You kissed her in her mouth, ask her how my dick taste
Bitch nigga you don't want no drama I'm worth a couple commas

Hands clap like a nigga in the stadium
Million dollar chain but I'm rocking 8 of 'em
