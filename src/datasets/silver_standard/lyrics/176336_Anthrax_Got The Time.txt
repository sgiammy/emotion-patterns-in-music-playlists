Wake up, got another day to get
Through now, got another man to see
Gotta call him on the telephone, way-o
Gotta find a piece of paper

Sit down, got another letter to write
Think hard, gotta get a letter just right
Little ringing on the telephone, woah no
Gotta write another letter

No such thing as tomorrow
All we want (two three go!)

Time!
Got the time tick, tick, tickin' in my head
Time!
Got the time tick, tick, tickin' in my head
Time!
Got the time tick, tick, tickin' in my head

Ticking in my head
Ticking in my head
Ticking in my head

If I tell you what I'm doing today
Will you shut up and get out of my way?
Someone asked me what the time is, I don't know
Only know I gotta go now

No time, tryin' to get a watch repaired
No time, never got a thing to wear
Little ringing on the telephone, woah no
Hear a ringing in my head now

No such thing as tomorrow
All we want (two three go!)

Time!
Got the time tick, tick, tickin' in my head
Time!
Got the time tick, tick, tickin' in my head
Time!
Got the time tick, tick, tickin' in my head

Ticking in my head 
Ticking in my head
Ticking in my head

No such thing as tomorrow
All we want (two three go!)

Time!
Got the time tick, tick, tickin' in my head
Time!
Got the time tick, tick, tickin' in my head
Time!
Got the time tick, tick, tickin' in my head

Ticking in my head
Time!
Got the time tick, tick, tickin' in my head
Time!
Got the time tick, tick, tickin' in my head
Time!
Got the time tick, tick, tickin' in my head

Ticking in my head
Ticking in my head
Ticking in my head
