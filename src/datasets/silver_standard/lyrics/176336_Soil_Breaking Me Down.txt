Let it go

How far will the fallin' star take me
How far can I go, can I go?
Gotta be what the nightmare made me
Gotta be, gotta be what I see
Jump clear of the fallin' parts from me
How far will they go, will they go?
Can't give what you want from me baby

Just let it go

Bringin' me down, break me down, sweet sugar
Bringin' me down, break me down
Breakin' me down to the ground, sweet baby
Breakin' me down to the ground

Too much is made of what's in me
Not enough about how I strive
Keep an eye on your world, it's cheating
Keep an eye, keep an eye on me
Deep inside there's a little place for me
A little place for me
Can't give what you want from me baby

Just leave it be

Bringin' me down, break me down, sweet sugar
Bringin' me down, break me down
Breakin' me down to the ground, sweet baby
Breakin' me down to the ground

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah-eah

Sweet razor wound
Deep down, slice my groove
Sweet razor wound
Deep down, c'mon and slice it

How far did the fallin' star take me
How far did I go, did I go?
Had to be what the nightmare made me
Fuck, just had to be
Jump clear of the fallin' parts from me
How far did they go, did they go?
Can't give what you want from me baby

Hell, just let it go

Bringin' me down, break me down, sweet sugar
Bringin' me down, break me down
Breakin' me down to the ground, sweet baby
Breakin' me down to the ground

Bringin' me down, bring me down (Sweet baby)
Bringin' me down, bring me down (Sweet sugar)
Bringin' me down to the ground, sweet baby
Breaking me down to the ground

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah-eah
