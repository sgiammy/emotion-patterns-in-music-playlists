Why am I so scared
That the shadows on the wall from yesterday...
I turn and tell my dad
I saw ghosts in the park wooing girls with cakes
And their moms are scared
'Cause they haven't been home in two or three days
Wind blows trees through the tops of my hair
I saw wolves in the fog, I can see through the rain

Oh, man and things have changed
In the snow filled lakes where there used to be waves
I feel deranged
They're building beaches inside so it's sunny on me
I don't know, I think it's strange
'Cause I know we met before but I cannot place it
I don't know if there's any real danger
But the creatures all know that it's safer in the dark

Why am I so scared
Of explosions going off just any old way
I turn, ask is it really that bad
They say we've much bigger problems, we got wolves on the plain
And they left their den 'cause of cracks in the pipes through the murky graves
They're running just as fast as the hares
They say you shouldn't leave a place if you can eat there
Oh, man, and things have changed
In the snow filled lakes where there used to be waves
I feel deranged
They're building beaches inside so it's sunny on me
I don't know, I think it's strange
'Cause I know we met before but I cannot place it
I don't know if there's any real danger
But I'm alright if you're alright
I'm alright if you're alright, man

She cuts her diamonds so they
Look like a decoy lover
Many have fine costumes but they're not like mine
He said I'd kiss you, sometimes I
Don't wanna kiss you, don't mean I
Don't like to kiss you, just means these lips are mine
He just don't jerk and he just don't work and
He got wrapped up in loving but
We opened him just in time
He said don't make your problems my funny problems
Because I've got problems but I'll cover them up in time
Don't make your troubles my funny troubles
Because I've got troubles
Why we talk about 'em all the time
Like crocodiles sometimes I wanna eat him
Sometimes I just wanna meet him for a
Good meal but to eat you better win so loud
Like crocodiles sometimes he just wanna basement
Sometimes, man, he can never take it when he
Do not look at you but deep inside it's fine, thinking about

Torture
Don't let it get you down
There's other ways to fight
Torture
I hope it gets you 'round
Shaking it off with me

Man, now don't get too freaky on me
