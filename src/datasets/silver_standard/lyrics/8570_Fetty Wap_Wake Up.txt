Telling you guys how I feel man

When you wake up in the morning, ay
Mom's yellin'g in your room
Like can I get 5 more minutes?
Shit, I ain't really tripping over school
Let's get Wiz Khalifa high and
Get meditated over medicated
Get Wiz Khalifa high and
Throw your caps in the air like you know you made it, ay
When you wake up in the morning, ay
Mom's yelling in your room
Like can I get 5 more minutes?
Shit, I ain't really tripping over school
Let's get Wiz Khalifa high and
Get meditated over medicated
Get Wiz Khalifa high and
Throw your caps in the air like you know you made it

I told moms I ain't tripping over school 'cause I made it
Said, Boy you got a son, supposed to be his inspiration
Put a milli in his bank account, don't leave him, I was thinking
I'll never do him wrong like they did the operation
Took a nigga's vision from him, was a mothafucking baby
Said a couple years later they could give it back to me
Technology is moving too slow, I'm waiting patiently
Shit, I don't want it no more, this how I'm meant to be
Remember young kids in the school used to laugh at him
Guess I played my numbers real good, check the mathematics
Nigga brought the Zoovie Zoo up, why they mad at him?
Man I bought about 12 cars just to blast past
Switch cars so much, don't know which one to blast at
And my bitch so bad and you know her ass fat
Wanna ride through, man, ay, Zoo'll laugh at
Zoo Gang my crew, won't put nothing past that

When you wake up in the morning, ay
Mom's yellin'g in your room
Like can I get 5 more minutes?
Shit, I ain't really tripping over school
Let's get Wiz Khalifa high and
Get meditated over medicated
Get Wiz Khalifa high and
Throw your caps in the air like you know you made it, ay
When you wake up in the morning, ay
Mom's yelling in your room
Like can I get 5 more minutes?
Shit, I ain't really tripping over school
Let's get Wiz Khalifa high and
Get meditated over medicated
Get Wiz Khalifa high and
Throw your caps in the air like you know you made it

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, baby, yeah, yeah baby

When you wake up in the morning, ay
Mom's yellin'g in your room
Like can I get 5 more minutes?
Shit, I ain't really tripping over school
Let's get Wiz Khalifa high and
Get meditated over medicated
Get Wiz Khalifa high and
Throw your caps in the air like you know you made it, ay
When you wake up in the morning, ay
Mom's yelling in your room
Like can I get 5 more minutes?
Shit, I ain't really tripping over school
Let's get Wiz Khalifa high and
Get meditated over medicated
Get Wiz Khalifa high and
Throw your caps in the air like you know you made it
