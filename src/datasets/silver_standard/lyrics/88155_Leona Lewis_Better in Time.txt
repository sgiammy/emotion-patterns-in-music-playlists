It's been the longest winter without you 
I didn't know where to turn to 
See, somehow I can't forget you 
After all that we've been through 

Goin', comin' thought I heard a knock 
Who's there, no one 
Thinking that I deserve it 
Now I realize that I really didn't know 
If you didn't notice you mean everything 
Quickly I'm learning to love again 
All I know is I'm gon' be okay

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too (Oh yeah)
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time

I couldn't turn on the TV 
Without something there to remind me 
Was it all that easy 
To just put aside your feelings 

If I'm dreaming don't wanna let it 
Hurt my feelings but that's the path 
I believe in 
And I know time will heal it 
If you didn't notice boy you meant everything 
Quickly I'm learning to love again 
All I know is I'm gon' be okay

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too (Oh yeah)
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time

Since there's no more you and me (no more you and me)
It's time I let you go 
So I can be free 
And live my life how it should be 
No matter how hard it is I'll be fine without you 
Yes I will 

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too (Ohh)
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to (Yes I do)
It'll all get better in time

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too
(Yeah)
It'll all get better in time
Even though I really loved you
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to
