Hey, I'm feelin' tired, my time is gone today
You flirt with suicide sometimes, that's okay
Do what others say, I'm here standing hollow
Falling away from me, falling away from me
The day is here, fading, that's when I'm insane
I flirt with suicide sometimes, kill the pain
I can't always say, "It's gonna be better tomorrow"
Falling away from me, falling away from me

Beating me down, beating me, beating me down, down into the ground
Screaming some sound, beating me, beating me down, down, into the ground

(Falling away from me)
It's spinning round and round
(Falling away from me)
It's lost and can't be found
(Falling away from me)
It's spinning round and round
(Falling away from me)
Slow it down

Beating me down, beating me, beating me down, down into the ground
Screaming some sound, beating me, beating me down, down, into the ground

Twisting me, then walk away
So I pray, "Go away"

Life's falling away from me, it's falling away from me
Life's falling away from me, fuck

Beating me down, beating me, beating me down, down into the ground
Screaming some sound, beating me, beating me down, down, into the ground
(Falling away from me)
Beating me down, beating me, beating me
(Falling away from me) 
Down, down, into the ground
(Falling away from me)
Screaming some sound, beating me, beating me
(Falling away from me) 
Down, down, into the ground
