I got my choppa in my 'rari
In case I see my enemy

Tonight I'm on this Hennessy
I won't usually do the brown
But tonight is special (special)
Sam Rothstein be my agenda, yeah my special
My 2 door is retarded, I call that bitch special-ed

Another year, same haters, usual suspects
Word 'bout another nigga, I swear that shit is suspect
Keyser Soze, sold the yay' and I got away
Hit the club, there fresh, in case I die today

So hard to be alone
But right here at this moment you the one I want to roll so...
You got the baby baby, it's in your hands

Pussy so tight my tongue get stuck, my tongue get stuck like licking ice
Hoes call me QB, I throw that dick too deep

She said ah me so horny, he love me long time

I say true you ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
And you know they say love is blind, so close your eyes
