(Intro/chorus: b.o.b)
She likes it real slow (slow)
Then we speed it up like ooh (ooh)
Baby turn around like so (so)
Now we got it just like
Something that we both like
Baby we can go so high (so high)
Higher then you've ever been high (uh)
Higher then you've ever been high (thugga)
Now we got it just like
Something that we both like
Baby we can go so high
(Verse 1: slim thug)
So high
Thugga'll make her head touch the sky
It's so good she look like she about to cry
Opposite of dry baby stay soaking wet
This the best this spot is as good as it gets
She rubbing on my chest I'm kissing on her neck
We're going long going strong body full of sweat
And like the saxatrone thugga got her mind blown
Everytime she come home she trying to climb on
Addicted to the dick stay trying to get her head
Date time we make time just to get it quick
I tell 'em meet me here like I'm about to hit a lick
Bring her over and let her get it quick
(Chorus: b.o.b)
She likes it real slow (slow)
Then we speed it up like ooh (ooh)
Baby turn around like so (so)
Now we got it just like
Something that we both like
Baby we can go so high (high ha)
Higher then you've ever been high (high ha)
Higher then you've ever been high (high ha)
Now we got it just like (right)
Something that we both like (right like right like)
Baby we can go so high (high ha)
(Verse 2: b.o.b)
First she wants it slow then she wants it beat
Then she wants it deep then she taps into that innerfreak
Don't be shy just get loose and show me how it is your feet
I like her and she likes her and I'm like why must we compete
Now it's 3 of us in deep in nar
I don't need no sheets I'm a sleep in the stars
As scruffy as the signs so I'm just the type of guy

We're flyin where you've never been we finna get high
That's higher then you've ever been higher than cloud nine
We're going where you've never been so sit your ass down
Like the singing in this song let me see you turn around
And [?] like the haters going down for the count
(Chorus: b.o.b)
She likes it real slow (slow)
Then we speed it up like ooh (ooh)
Baby turn around like so (so)
Now we got it just like
Something that we both like
Baby we can go so high (high)
Higher then you've ever been high (high)
Higher then you've ever been high (high)
Now we got it just like
Something that we both like
Baby we can go so high (high)
(Verse 3: slim thug)
I aim to please so believe I leave you satisfied
A lifetime warranty whenever you ride
I say that with pride (pride) and I honor that (honor that)
It's guaranteed good service you'll be coming back
Just like a drug girl you need thug
Got you in love thugga'll make your heart speed up
Roll your weed up it's time for thug passion
Now put your feet up I'm a keep smashing
Keep it lasting till you're higher than you've ever been
I'll take your mind and body places it never been
Yeah just hit me up if you need a hit
Thug boss on the sway but she's so thick
(Chorus: b.o.b)
She likes it real slow (slow)
Then we speed it up like ooh (ooh)
Baby turn around like so (so)
Now we got it just like
Something that we both like
Baby we can go so high (high)
Higher then you've ever been high (high)
Higher then you've ever been high (high)
Now we got it just like
Something that we both like
Baby we can go so high (high high)
