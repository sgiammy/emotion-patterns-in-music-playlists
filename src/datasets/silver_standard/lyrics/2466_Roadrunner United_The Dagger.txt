Your tongue is a dagger 
And I am bleeding 
My faded dreams were all for you 

And with one word
And with just one word 
Choking the life
I breathe my last 
And with one look
And with just one look 
You hold the key to this heart of glass 

This is the withering 
I'm aging years in moments 
This is the path that leads 
To my demise 

Your tongue is a dagger 
And I am bleeding 
My faded dreams were all for you 

And with one word
And with just one word 
You've shattered my world and crushed my soul 
And with one look
And with just one look 
The rising sun has never felt so cold 

This is the suffering 
The echoes of your voice haunt 
This faded memory 
Is my demise 

Your tongue is a dagger 
And I am bleeding 
My faded dreams were all for

And I feel this all too slow 
And I've been here for so long 
And I feel so empty 
As you walk away 

What have you done

I would give it all away 
For the chance to shine again 
I would freely pay the price 
For the touch of your hand 

And I feel this all too slow 
And I've been here for so long 
And I feel so empty 
As you walk away 

What have you done
What have you become
All is lost 
We are left with sorrow
