I'm just a step away
I'm a just a breath away
Losin' my faith today
(I'm falling off the edge today)

I am just a man
Not superhuman
(I'm not superhuman)
Someone save me from the hate

It's just another war
Just another family torn
(I'm falling from my faith today)
Just a step from the edge
Just another day in the world we live

I need a Hero
To save me now
I need a Hero
(Save me now)
I need a Hero
To save my life
A Hero will save me
(Just in time)

I've gotta fight today
To live another day
Speakin' my mind today
(My voice will be heard today)

I've gotta make a stand
But I am just a man
(I'm not superhuman)
My voice will be heard today

It's just another war
Just another family torn
(My voice will be heard today)
It's just another kill
The countdown begins to destroy ourselves

I need a Hero
To save me now
I need a Hero
(Save me now)
I need a Hero
To save my life
A Hero'll save me
(Just in time)
I need a Hero
To save my life
I need a Hero
Just in time

Save me just in time
Save me just in time

Who's gonna fight for what's right
Who's gonna help us survive
We're in the fight of our lives
(And we're not ready to die)

Who's gonna fight for the weak
Who's gonna make 'em believe
I've got a Hero
(I've got a Hero)
Livin' in me

I'm gonna fight for what's right
Today I'm speaking my mind
And if it kills me tonight
(I will be ready to die)

A Hero's not afraid to give His life
A Hero's gonna save me just in time

I need a Hero
To save me now
I need a Hero
(Save me now)
I need a Hero
To save my life
A Hero'll save me
(Just in time)

I need a Hero
Who's gonna fight for what's right
Who's gonna help us survive

I need a Hero
Who's gonna fight for the weak
Who's gonna make 'em believe

I need a Hero
I need a Hero

A Hero's gonna save me
Just in time
