If I told you
That this couldn't get better baby
And your heart beat
It let's me know you feel the same
I can hold you
Keep you safe until you fall asleep
Never worry
'Cause I can give you what you need

Now everything I do
Is all for loving you
Is not something that we're used to
No other way to say
I need you everyday
And now I'm gonna change my ways
And it's a part of you I never wanna lose
I'd do anything you want me to
Like any other day
I know I'll find a way
And if ever I'm alone, you say

I'll be thinking about you
I'll be thinking about you
I'll be thinking about you
I'll be thinking about you

In a moment
I know that everything can change
And I know that my life will never be the same
You're the only one that's making sense to me
When I close my eyes you're the one I see
There's no other way
I can ever be without you babe

Now everything I do
Is all for loving you
Is not something that we're used to
No other way to say
I need you everyday
And now I'm gonna change my ways
And it's a part of you I never wanna lose
I'd do anything you want me to
Like any other day
I know I'll find a way
And if ever I'm alone, you say

I'll be thinking about you
I'll be thinking about you
I'll be thinking about you
I'll be thinking about you
