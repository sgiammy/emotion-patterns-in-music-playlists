Stay for tonight
If you want to, I can show you
What my dreams are made of
As I'm dreaming of your face

I've been away for a long time
Such a long time and I miss you there
I can't imagine being anywhere else
I can't imagine being anywhere else but here

How the hell did you ever pick me?
Honestly, I could sing you a song
But I don't think words can express your beauty (Beauty)
It's singing to me

How the hell did we end up like this?
You bring out the beast in me
I fell in love from the moment we kissed
Since then we've been history

They say that love is forever
Your forever is all that I need (Is all that I need)
Please stay as long as you need
Can't promise that things won't be broken
But I swear that I will never leave (I will never leave)
Please stay forever with me

It goes to show
I hope that you know that you are
What my dreams are made of

Can't fall asleep, can't fall asleep
I lie in my bed awake, in my bed awake at night
As I dream of you

I'll fall in love, you'll fall in love
It could mean everything, everything to me
I can't imagine being anywhere else

They say that love is forever
Your forever is all that I need (Is all that I need)
Please stay as long as you need
Can't promise that things won't be broken
But I swear that I will never leave (I will never leave)
Please stay forever with me

The way that we are is the reason I stay
As long as you're here with me, I know we'll be okay
The way that we are is the reason I stay
As long as you're here with me, I know I'll be okay

They say that love is forever
Your forever is all that I need (Is all that I need)
Please stay as long as you need
Can't promise that things won't be broken
But I swear that I will never leave (I will never leave)
Please stay forever with me

(I couldn't love just anyone)
They say that love is forever
(I was created to love just one baby)
Your forever is all that I need
(I couldn't love just anyone)
Please stay as long as you need
(I was created to love just one girl)

(I couldn't love just anyone)
Can't promise that things won't be broken
(I was created to love just one baby)
But I swear that I will never leave
(I couldn't love just anyone)
Please stay forever with me
(I was created to love just one girl)
