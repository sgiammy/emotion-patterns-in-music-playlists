And I be rocking Prada like a devil in this bitch
And a Birkin bag like a gold medal to this bitch
And I'm heavy as it get
Shining like a motherfuckin' bezel on my wrist
All my niggas mobbing so we heavy in this bitch
30 grand for the Muller that's a Chevy on my wrist
Cocaine Mulsanne, young nigga blowing up - Kurt Cobain
Skating on them like I'm Lil Wayne
And this 458 don't do the lil lane - vroom
Swerve on 'em, niggas gotta nerve on 'em
'Cause I heard the feds got 'em and he had them birds on 'em
But a nigga back home and now niggas roll wit him
Caught a case what you think, nigga fucking told on 'em
I ain't get my shit snatched yet
You ain't get your bitch back yet
One call, niggas aim that tech
Blood drawn, headshot nigga brains on step
Hot shit if you pop shit

In a range with your honey, I pull up like ah

Them boys shooting don't play with them

Rolling down Collins call Rugs hit the A with them
Compound niggas live now
If it's the finals I'm balling like I'm LeBron now
I call up Odyssey tell them bitches to calm down
I treat the jet like a taxi way the way I'm flying around
And I don't fuck with no niggas
If they don't fuck with my niggas
And I ain't fucking no bitches
If they fucking my niggas

Lil nigga we don't rock the same clothes, fuck the same hoes
'Cause its levels to this shit
