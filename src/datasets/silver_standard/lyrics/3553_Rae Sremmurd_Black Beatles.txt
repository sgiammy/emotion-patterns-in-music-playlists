Black Beatles in the city be back immediately
To confiscate the moneys
Rae Sremm, Guwop, Mike WiLL!
Sent flowers but you said you didn't receive them
But you said you didn't need them

That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Release the cash, watch it fall slowly

Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

Gettin' so cold, I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
There is nothing to explain

I'm a fuckin' black Beatle, cream seats in the Regal
Rockin John Lennon lenses like to see 'em spread eagle
Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table
Screamin' "everybody's famous"

Like clockwork, I blow it all
And get some more
Get you somebody that can do both
Black Beatles got the babes belly rolling
She think she love me, I think she trollin'

That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Release the cash, watch it fall slowly

Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

Came in with two girls, look like strippers in their real clothes
A broke hoe can only point me to a rich hoe
A yellow bitch with green hair, a real weirdo
Black man, yellow Lamb', real life goals

They seen that Guwop and them just came in through the side door
There's so much money on the floor we buyin' school clothes
Watch me break the money machine till her clothes fall
Pint of lean, pound of weed, and a kilo

I eurostep past a hater like I'm Rondo
I upgrade your baby mama to a condo
Like Chapos servin' yayo to the gringos
Black Beatle, club close when I say so

That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Release the cash, watch it fall slowly

Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

She's a good teaser
And we blowin' reefer
Your body like a work of art, baby
Don't fuck with me, I'll break your heart, baby

Slim Jxmmi, I got a lot of flavor
Fifteen hundred on my feet, I'm tryna kill these haters
I got haters when I was broke, I'm rich, I still got haters
I had hoes when I was broke, I'm rich, I'm still a player

I wear leather Gucci jackets like its still the 80's
I've been blowin' OG Kush, I feel a little sedated
I can't worry about a broke nigga or a hater
Black Beatle, bitch, me and Paul McCartney related

That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Release the cash, watch it fall slowly

Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

Mike Will man
