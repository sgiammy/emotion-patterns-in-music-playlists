Thugger! YSL for life
We ran up them digits we ran up some money

Nigga, hustlers don't stop, they keep going
You can lose your life but it gon' keep going
Why not risk life when it's gon' keep going?
When you die somebody else was born
But at least we got to say we...

I'm living like I'm on a 5th of the Henny
I talk lots of shit like my bitches and digits
They didn't know me well so I left 'em with you
You know it's that drop when you bright and can't flip it
I'm livin' big, I swear to God I'm Liu Kang kickin'
Montana
Mama gon' slime, hustle
Dopeboy, hair grey like a grandma
You know my ice blingin', light up just like a candle
Rollie pollie, I can control shawty like a channel
My racks are squeakin', I'm not fartin'
I hop in that 'Rari, I crank up like Warren

Nigga, hustlers don't stop, they keep going
You can lose your life but it's gon' keep going
Why not risk life when it's got keep going?
When you die somebody else was born

I'ma move me some dope like I'm Future
I'ma go in that bitch with a ruler
I'ma toast me a nigga like Strudels
I'ma keep a red flag 'cause I'm boolin'
I know some roller spaces, I could deul it
Yeah, yeah I'm screaming oh my god like Cooly
When I snort it, I feel like I run the work
If I ever die, he better drop his first
I've been getting money before the million, fuck Pandora
I can do this shit when I get bored
