I might never be your knight in shining armor
I might never be the one you take home to mother
And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
But I can be the one, be the one tonight

When I first saw you from across the room
I could tell that you were curious, oh yeah
Girl, I hope you're sure what you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises

But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous 
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then baby I'm perfect, baby I'm perfect for you

And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can't even pronounce 
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Baby you're perfect, baby you're perfect
So let's start right now

I might never be the hand you put your heart in
Or the arms that hold you anytime you want them
But that don't mean that we can't live here in the moment
'Cause I can be the one you love from time to time

When I first saw you from across the room
I could tell that you were curious, oh yeah
Girl, I hope you're sure what you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises

But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous 
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then baby I'm perfect, baby I'm perfect for you

And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can't even pronounce 
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Baby you're perfect, baby you're perfect
So let's start right now

And if you like cameras flashing every time we go out, oh yeah
And if you're looking for someone to write your break up songs about
Baby I'm perfect, baby we're perfect

But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous 
If you like the do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then baby I'm perfect, baby I'm perfect for you

And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can't even pronounce 
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Baby you're perfect, baby you're perfect
So let's start right now
