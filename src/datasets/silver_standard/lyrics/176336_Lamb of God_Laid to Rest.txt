If there was a single day I could live
A single breath I could take
I'd trade all the others away

The blood's on the wall
So you might as well just admit it
And bleach out the stains
Commit to forgetting it

You're better off empty and blank
Than left with a single pathetic trace of this
Smother another failure
Lay this to rest

Console yourself
You're better alone
Destroy yourself
See who gives a fuck

Absorb yourself
You're better alone
Destroy yourself

I'll chain you to the truth
For the truth shall set you free
I'll turn the screws of vengeance
And bury you with honesty

I'll make all your dreams come to life
Then slay them as quickly as they came
Smother another failure
Lay this to rest

Console yourself
You're better alone
Destroy yourself
See who gives a fuck

Absorb yourself
You're better alone
Destroy yourself

See who gives a fuck
See who gives a fuck
See who gives a fuck

Failure

If there was a day I could live
If there was a single breath I could take
I'd trade all the others away
I'd trade all the others away
