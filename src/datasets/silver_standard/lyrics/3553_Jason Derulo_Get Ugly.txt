Girl, ladies, let your hurr down
Let your hurr down
We's about to get down

Oh my, oh my, oh my God
This girl's straight and this girl's not
Tipsy off that peach Ciroc

Ching-a-lang-lang, ching-a-ling-a-lang-lang
Jeans so tight I could see loose change
Do your thang, thang, girl
Do that thang like la la la

Tell them pretty faced girls tryna brass each other
And them undercover freaks who ain't nothin' but trouble
Baby, I'mma tell you some' only 'cause I love ya
People all around the world sexy motherfuckers

Get ugly
You're too sexy to me
Sexy to me
You're too sexy to me
Sexy to me

Damn, that's ugly

Bruh... I can't, I can't even lie

Someone else gon' have to drive me home
La la la
Bang-a-rang-rang, bang-a-ring-a-rang-rang
Bass in the trunk, vibrate that thang
Do your thang, thang, girl
Do that thang like la la la

Tell them pretty faced girls tryna brass each other
And them undercover freaks who ain't nothin' but trouble
Baby, I'mma tell you some' only 'cause I love ya
People all around the world sexy motherfuckers

Get ugly
Get ugly, baby, woo hoo
And everybody say la la la
Get ugly
You're too sexy to me
Sexy to me
You're too sexy to me
Sexy to me

Damn, that's ugly

Everybody lose control
Let's get ugly, dysfunctional
Everybody lose control
Let's get ugly, dysfunctional

Tell them pretty faced girls tryna brass each other
And them undercover freaks who ain't nothin' but trouble
Baby, I'mma tell you some' only 'cause I love ya
People all around the world sexy motherfuckers

Light them up then pass that, pass that
La la la
Everybody lose control
Let's get ugly, dysfunctional
Get ugly
