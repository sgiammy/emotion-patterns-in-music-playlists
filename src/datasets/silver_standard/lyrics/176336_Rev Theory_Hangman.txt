Take your places please
You'll need to sit for this one
It's a simple plan
With a mangled conclusion

Give us a minute alone
You're gonna follow me down

Hangman, you wanna follow me
How long, into the bottom we're
Headstrong, drink from the bottle
Until this city tears us both apart

Hangman, hang

Numb your senses please
You won't remember for too long
Sound the hell alarm
And commence the corruption

Give us a minute alone
You're gonna follow me down

Hangman, you wanna follow me
How long, into the bottom we're
Headstrong, drink from the bottle
Until this city tears us both apart

Hangman, you wanna follow me
Hang on, into the bottom we're
Headstrong, drink from the bottle
Until this city tears us both apart

Hangman, hang
Hangman, hang

You're gonna follow me
You're gonna follow me down
You're gonna follow me
You're gonna follow me down

You're gonna follow me
You're gonna follow me down
You're gonna follow me
You're gonna follow me down

Give us a minute alone
You're gonna follow me down

Hangman, you wanna follow me
How long, into the bottom we're
Headstrong, drink from the bottle
Until this city tears us both apart

Hangman, you wanna follow me
Hang on, into the bottom we're
Headstrong, drink from the bottle
Until this city tears us both apart

Hangman, hang
Hangman, hang
