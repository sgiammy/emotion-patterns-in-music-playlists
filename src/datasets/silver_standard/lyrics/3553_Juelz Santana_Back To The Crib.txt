She wanna roll with me, she wanna go with with me
But she don't know I'm tryin' to take her back home with me
I told her have a seat in my ride
She said I look like I taste good and she wanna eat me alive

She lookin' good in them new tall heels
I'm looking at her like a four course meal
Chill, I got all the girls checkin' me
They know I'm a dog, but they love my pedigree

Yeah, just call me Mr. Orgasm
And if you come with me, I guarantee you're gon' have one
Hottest in the hood, freshest on the block
Why stop on this Gucci and this Louie that I rock?

If not, I stay Polo down to the socks
Rings, chain and the watch worth more than Fort Knox
Temporary place on the Audi R8
Diamonds match what I'm wearing, she can't stop staring

Runway walk, beauty Queen face
Video body, see the curves in her shape
And everything her momma gave her, she know how to shake
Thicker than a milkshake, and I'm tryna get a taste

Her hair did, manicure, pedicure, attitude like Vivica
When she play, they set it off
She feelin' my swag, she feelin' my G
Not only is she dancing, she feeling on me, and I'm feeling you too

So I put my hands on her
Just to let her know the feeling's mutual
Lil' mama, we can birthday text
Yes I said text, but I know you know what I really meant

Tell me what you will do, tell me what you won't do
Tell me what you don't know how to do so I can show you
I'ma give it to you, give it to you like I owe you
And after I'm done, I'ma tell you I told you
