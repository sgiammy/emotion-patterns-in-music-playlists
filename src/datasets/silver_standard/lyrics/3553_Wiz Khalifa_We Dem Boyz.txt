Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we dem boys
Hol' up, we dem boys
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we makin' noise
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up

Hol' up, we dem boys
Hol' up, we dem boys
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we makin' noise
Hol' up, hol' up, we dem boys

Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, pop a bottle
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, if you suck it swallow
Smell that marijuana, they gon' follow
Throwin' money on her like she won the lotto

Pussy must be serious
Hol' up
Scared of heights come face your fears
Hol' up, hol' up
Do it just like Nicki go on and bend it over
Say she never smoked I turned her to a stoner

Young nigga but I'm ready
Oh, foreign girls call me sexy
And white girls gimme Becky
But first I gotta roll this joint
Baby, hol' up, hol' up

Hol' up, we dem boys
Hol' up, we dem boys
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we makin' noise
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up

Hol' up, we dem boys
Hol' up, we dem boys
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we makin' noise
Hol' up, hol' up, we dem boys

Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, you drive me crazy
Number one bitch, you can't replace me
Leave the club these hoes be tryna' chase me
You got a ass so fat let's make a baby

Damn, I'm smokin' weed in my Mercedes
Hol' up, these niggas broke, these niggas lazy
Man they money slim, they actin' shady
I'm in my brand new car, who wanna race?

Hoe, bitch, you ain't call my phone so why you showin' up?
I'm takin' them shots all my niggas stay loaded up
Man on the low all these hoes be actin' so material
Hol' up man, did you see her interior?

Hol' up, we dem boys
Hol' up, we dem boys
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we makin' noise
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up

Hol' up, we dem boys
Hol' up, we dem boys
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, we makin' noise
Hol' up, hol' up, we dem boys
