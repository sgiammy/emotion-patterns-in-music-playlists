I wanted to forget
How you swallowed me whole
I wanted to suggest
We let the shit go

I overstayed a while
And let you beat on my soul
I never could digest
How you were so cold

Concealed behind a smile
Were teeth as sharp as they shone
The bullet in your hand
It had my name on

I'm gonna run and hide
I'll disappear for a while
I feel so dead inside
And it's all your fault

But you don't feed me now
No longer hold me down
You'll never watch me drown
I hope you figure it out
No longer sickened with doubt
You'll never watch me drown

With every day gone by
I felt so useless and old
I never could decide
Why it should be so

Another wasted try
To save what I can't control
I feel so dead inside
And it's all your fault

But you don't feed me now
No longer hold me down
You'll never watch me drown
I hope you figure it out
No longer sickened with doubt
You'll never watch me drown

I wanted to forget
How you swallowed me whole
I wanted to suggest
We let the shit go

I overstayed a while
And let you beat on my soul
I never could digest
How you were so cold

But you don't feed me now
No longer hold me down
You'll never watch me drown
I hope you figure it out
No longer sickened with doubt
You'll never watch me drown

But you don't feed me now
No longer hold me down
You'll never watch me drown
I hope you figure it out
No longer sickened with doubt
You'll never watch me drown
