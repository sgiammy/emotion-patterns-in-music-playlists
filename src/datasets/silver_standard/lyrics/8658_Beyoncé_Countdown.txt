Boy...

Oh! Killing me softly, and I'm still fallin';
Still the one I need - I will always be with you...
Whoa! You got me all gone - don't ever let me go;
Say it real loud if you fly:
"If you leave me, you out of your mind!"

My baby is a (10);
We dressin' to the (9),
He pick me up, we (8);
Make me feel so lucky (7)...
He kiss me in his (6);
We be makin' love in (5)...
Still the one I do this (4)
I'm tryna make a (3) from the (2);
Still the one.

There's ups and downs in this love;
Got a lot to learn in this love...
Through the good and the bad, still got love;
Dedicated to the one I love...

I still love the way he talk, he still love the way I sing;
Still the way he love them black diamonds in that chain...
Still hot up on each other, ain't a damn thing changed;
My girls can't tell me nothin' - I'm gone in the brain...

I'm all up under him like it's cold - wintertime;
All up in the kitchen in my heels - dinnertime...
Do whatever that it takes, he got a winner's mind;
Give it all to him, meet him at the finish line...

Me, and my boo, and my boo boo, ridin';
All up in that black, with his chick right beside him...
Ladies, if you love yo' man, show him you the flyest;
Grind up on it, girl, show him how you ride it...

Me, and my boo, and my boo boo, ridin';
All up in that black, with his chick right beside him...
Ladies, if you love yo' man, show him you the flyest;
Grind up on it, girl, show him how you ride it...

Oh! Killing me softly, and I'm still fallin';
Still the one I need - I will always be with you...

Still the one.

If I put it on him, it ain't nothin' that I can't do;
Yep, I buy my own - if he deserve it, buy his shit too...
All up in the sto' - Shawty trickin' if I want to;
All up in the sto' - Shawty, fly as we want to...

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...)
Damn, I think I love that boy - do anything for that boy;
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...) Boy...
Now I'll never be the same - it's you and me until the end...

Me, and my boo, and my boo boo, ridin';
All up in that black, with his chick right beside him...
Ladies, if you love yo' man, show him you the flyest;
Grind up on it, girl, show him how you ride it...

Me, and my boo, and my boo lip-lockin';
All up in the back, cause the chicks keep blockin'!
All that gossipin' - 10 years, stop it!
London, speed it up - Houston, rock it!

Oh! Killing me softly, and I'm still fallin';
Still the one I need - I will always be with you...
