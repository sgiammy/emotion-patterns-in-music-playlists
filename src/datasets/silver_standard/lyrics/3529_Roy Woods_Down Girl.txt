I can tell that she wants me but I don't want her, don't want her, don't want her
Bare gyal a pree something for me they're all whining, they're all whining, they're all whining
I was with her up late night till she cabbed in the morning, cabbed in the morning, cabbed in the morning
Bad bitches in here, but what do they all want me for?

(Pre-Hook)
All that I see in the jawn
Is the girl that every other nigga wants
Clique turnt up, all burnt up
After this girl, I'mma take you where they won't
All that I see in the jawn
Is the girl that every other nigga wants
Clique turnt up, all burnt up turnt up
After this girl, I'mma take you where they won't

I need a girl that I can freak on a weekday
I need a girl that's always down to come see me
I need a girl to roll the blunt, to smoke with me
I need a girl to make all this shit easy

What do you have? All that I need
You the type of girl to rock gold in your teeth
Don't care about a rich nigga or a broke nigga
Always keep it real with me, I'm your nigga
Good girl with the bad fat ass
Got me feeling like a nerd with an Asthma attack
Rolling through Sauga from the town that we stay at
Pushed me on the bed, shawty told me, to lay back, whoa

Whoa-oh
Few here are innocent, all these girls guilty
Fuck me over dirty, I'll do you filthy
Just cause you roll with me, don't mean you're with me
Oh, you ain't the girl that this young nigga's needing

I need a girl that I can freak on a weekday
I need a girl that's always down to come see me
(All these girls guilty)
I need a girl to roll the blunt, to smoke with me
(Fuck me over dirty, I'll do you filthy)
