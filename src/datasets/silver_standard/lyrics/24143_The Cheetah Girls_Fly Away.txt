We're standing on the edge of something
Do we stay or do we run
It's obvious that everything's changed

My head can't seem to figure out
Why my heart is full of doubt
Maybe we're just tired of the game

Guess you never know what's gonna happen
So you do the best you can
Following your soul might bring you back
Or it may have another plan

Please don't let it fly away, high away
Gotta keep it together
Feel for the flow
Don't fly away, high away
Please don't
No don't, don't let it fly away

We've never felt this place before
Wondering if anymore
We can find in us what it takes

It's not about who's to blame
I pray that they're just growing pains
Laughing while they're testing our faith

'Cause you never know what's gonna happen
So you do the best you can
Following our souls might bring us back
Unless it has another plan

Please don't let it fly away, high away
Gotta keep it together
Feel for the flow
Don't fly away, high away
Please don't
No don't, don't let it fly away

It's yes, it's no
We stay, we go
Feels like we're questioning everything, yeah
We run, we fall, but through it all (through it all)
We never thought we would break
We never thought we would break

Please don't let it fly away, high away
Gotta keep it together
Feel for the flow
Don't fly away, high away
Please don't
No don't, don't let it fly away

Please don't let it fly away, high away
Gotta keep it together
Feel for the flow
Don't fly away, high away
Please don't
No don't, don't let it fly away
