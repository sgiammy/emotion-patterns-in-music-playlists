Finn: Highway run into the midnight sun
Wheels go round and round, you're on my mind
Rachel: Restless hearts sleep alone tonight
Sending all my love along the wire

Both: They say that the road ain't no place to start a family
Right down the line it's been you and me
And loving a music man ain't always what it's supposed to be
Rachel: Oh boy, you stand by me
Both: I'm forever yours...faithfully

Rachel: Circus life, under the big top world
Both: We all need the clowns to make us smile
Rachel: Oh, through space and time
Finn: Through space and time
Both: Always another show
Wonderin' where I am, lost without you

And bein' a part ain't easy on this love affair
Two strangers learn to fall in love again
I get the joy of rediscovering you
Finn: Oh girl, you stand by me!
Both: I'm forever yours...faithfully

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh...
Finn: Faithfully (Oh oh oh oh)
Rachel: Faithfully (Oh oh oh oh oh)
I'm still yours (Oh oh oh oh oh oh...)

Both: Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh...
Rachel: I'm still yours
Both: Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh...
(Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh)
I'm still yours (Oh oh oh oh oh oh...)
Faithfully
