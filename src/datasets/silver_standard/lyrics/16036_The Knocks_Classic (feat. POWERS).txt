It was a summer time, that summer high
Oh what a masterpiece
The way your eyes met mine, sweet
Like apple pie, caught in your energy
The future came to me, I see

Yeah, it feels so classic
You and me, the magic
And I know we have it
'Cause it feels, yeah, it feels, yeah, it feels so classic
'Cause it feels, yeah, it feels, yeah, it feels so classic hmm

Don't be shy, don't be shy
Come to me baby, don't be shy

Oh what a summer time, when we lost our lines
Between the birds and bees
Buzzing in the blue sky, till the full moon rise
Playing with chemistry
Baby are you with me, oh

Yeah, it feels so classic
You and me, the magic hmm
And I know we have it
'Cause it feels, yeah, it feels yeah, it feels so classic hmm
'Cause it feels, yeah, it feels yeah, it feels so classic hmm
