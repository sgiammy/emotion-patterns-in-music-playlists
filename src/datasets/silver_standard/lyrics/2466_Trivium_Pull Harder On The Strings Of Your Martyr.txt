The face and the lips tremble as it rips (as it rips)
Your breath (your breath) quickening (quickening) as heat (as heat) rushes in

Pull harder, strings, martyr
Stop, you cry, That's a lie!
Flush gasping; white reddening
You smile and destroy it
It's time that we end this

It's our curse that makes this world so hopeless
Allowing our king to spread his genocidal wings

Clawing the skin
Each kill, your weakness
Annihilation (annihilation), your masturbation (your masturbation)
Tyrant, I'll burn you down

Pull harder, strings, martyr
Stop, you cry, That's a lie!
Flush gasping; white reddening
You smile and destroy it
It's time that we end this

It's our curse that makes this world so hopeless
Allowing our king to spread his genocidal wings
It's our curse that makes this world so hopeless
Allowing our king to spread his genocidal wing

My hands grip your throat
I need your end
Burned, staked, ripped apart
I avenge
For every life you have taken
I am here to repay

You ask me, Oh, God, why?
'Cause I'm God; that's fucking why"
For every life you have taken
I am here to repay

Pull harder, strings, martyr
Stop, you cry, That's a lie!
Flush gasping; white reddening
You smile and destroy it
It's time that we end this

It's our curse that makes this world so hopeless
Allowing our king to spread his genocidal wing
It's our curse that makes this world so hopeless
Allowing our king to spread his genocidal wing
