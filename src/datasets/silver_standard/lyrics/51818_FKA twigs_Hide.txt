Space
The only thing I ever knew

Place
With the time I know I'll have to choose, no

Stay beneath the ground
Hide away from you
I sink into the crowd
If it meant that I'd escape your eye

Hate
The only thing I give to you
Now

Face me
If you think you can take another route
Out

I let my sight be slayed
If it meant that I could form a view

I found another way
To caress my day
