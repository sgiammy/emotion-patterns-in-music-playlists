Round and round like a horse on a carousel
We go, will I catch up to love? I could never tell
I know chasing after you is like a fairy tale
But I feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel

Come, come one, come all, you must be this tall
To ride this ride at the carnival
Oh, come take my hand and run though playland
So high, too high at the carnival

And it's all fun and games
'Til somebody falls in love
But you already bought a ticket
And there's no turning back now

Round and round like a horse on a carousel
We go, will I catch up to love? I could never tell
I know chasing after you is like a fairy tale
But I feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel

This horse is too slow, we're always this close
Almost, almost, we're a freakshow
Right, right when I'm near, it's like you disappear
Where'd you go? Mr. Houdini, you're a freakshow!

And it's all fun and games
'Til somebody falls in love
But you already bought a ticket
And there's no turning back now

Round and round like a horse on a carousel
We go, will I catch up to love? I could never tell
I know chasing after you is like a fairy tale
But I feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel

Why did you steal my cotton candy heart?
You threw it in this damn coin slot
And now I'm stuck, I'm stuck riding, riding, riding

Round and round like a horse on a carousel
We go, will I catch up to love? I could never tell
I know chasing after you is like a fairy tale
But I feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel
