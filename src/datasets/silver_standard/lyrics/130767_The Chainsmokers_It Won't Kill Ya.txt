I know as the night goes on
You might end up with someone
So why do I bite my tongue?
Oh, I wanna know ya
I'm lookin' around the room
Is one of those strangers you?
And do you notice me too?
Oh, I wanna know ya

(I want ya) You're a face I won't forget
(I want ya) Don't know how much time is left
(I want ya) Haven't had a moment yet

Oh, dance with me, it won't kill ya
And one for the road
Dance with me, it won't kill ya
And one before you go
Dance with me, it won't kill ya
And one for the road
So why won't you stay a little longer?

Dance with me
Dance with me
(Mon amour)

You're putting your jacket on
Oh no, is the moment gone?
Don't wanna regret this one
Ooh, I wanna know ya

(I want ya) You're a face I won't forget
(I want ya) Don't know how much time is left
(I want ya) Haven't had a moment yet

Oh, dance with me, it won't kill ya
And one for the road
Dance with me, it won't kill ya
And one before you go
Dance with me, it won't kill ya
And one for the road
So why won't you stay a little longer?

Dance with me
(Mon amour)
Dance with me
(Mon amour)

I know as the night goes on
You might end up with someone
So why do I bite my tongue?
Ooh, I wanna know ya

Oh, dance with me, it won't kill ya
And one for the road
Dance with me, it won't kill ya
And one before you go
Dance with me, it won't kill ya
And one for the road
So why won't you stay a little longer?

So why don't you stay a little longer?
So why don't you stay a little longer?
Woah, woah, yeah
So why don't you stay a little longer?

So why don't you stay a little longer?
(So why don't you stay a little longer?)
