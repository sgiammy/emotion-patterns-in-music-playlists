Step up to me,
Step up to me!

You wanna be a big time player?
It's not to be

Look at all the snide ass,
Actin' like a wise ass
I'll fuck up your face
And you'll never look back

So when you fall to the ground
And finally get back to reality
No one at all is around
So tell me
How does it feel to be the enemy?

Step up to me,
Step up to me!

Step up to me,
Step up to me!

Step up to me,
Step up to me!

You wanna be a big time player?
It's not to be

Look at your face,
Look at your name
It's funny,
You're a loser with only yourself to blame
Cut your fucking hair now,
Scared of all the stare downs
You wanna be like me 'cause I'm real
So you steal on your way to fame

Never gonna be, never gonna see
Your name in the lights,
You can always dream
What you could've been
Clean up my shit,
You look like a dick
Step to unemployment
Step!

So when you fall to the ground
And finally get back to reality
No one at all is around
So tell me
How does it feel to be the enemy?

So when you fall to the ground
And finally get back to reality
No one at all is around
So tell me
How does it feel to be the enemy?
You're the enemy!

Step!
Step!
Step up to me, step up
You're the enemy!
Step!
Step!
Step up to me,
Step up to me!


So when you fall to the ground
And finally get back to reality
No one at all is around
So tell me
How does it feel to be the enemy?

So when you fall to the ground (Fall to the ground)
And finally get back to reality
No one at all is around
So tell me
How does it feel to be the enemy?
You're the enemy!

Step up to me,
Step up to me!

Step up to me,
Step up to me!

Step up to me,
Step up to me!

You wanna be a big time player?
It's not to be!
