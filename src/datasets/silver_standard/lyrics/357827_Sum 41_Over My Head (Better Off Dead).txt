What happened to you?
You've played the victim for so long now in this game.
What I thought was true
Is made of fiction and I'm following the same.
But if I try to make sense of this mess I'm in
I'm not sure where I should begin.
I'm falling, I'm falling...

Now I'm in
Over my head, with something I said
Completely misread I'm better off dead.
And now I can see, how fake you can be
This hypocrisy's beginning to get to me.

It's none of my concern.
Why look to me 'cause I don't believe in fame.
I guess you never heard.
I've met our makers they don't even know your name.
But if I had to say goodbye to leave this hell
I'd say my time has served me well.
I'm falling, I'm falling...

Now I'm in
Over my head, with something I said
Completely misread I'm better off dead.
And now I can see, how fake you can be
This hypocrisy's beginning to get to...

This came long before,
Those who suffer more
I'm too awake for this to be a nightmare.
What's with my disgrace
I lost the human race
No one plans for it to blow up in their face!

Who said it was easy to put back all these pieces?
Who said it was so easy to put back all of these pieces?

Now I'm in
Over my head, with something I said
Completely misread I'm better off dead.
And now I can see, how fake you can be
This hypocrisy's beginning to get to me.

Over my head, better off dead.
Over my head, better off dead--all right!
