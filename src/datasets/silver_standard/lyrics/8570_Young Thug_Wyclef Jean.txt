This Actavis by the way I promise, on God

Okay, my money way longer than a Nascar race
I told her keep going on the gas, fuck the brakes
Only here for one night, let me put it on your face
Let a nigga nut, only way I'll go to sleep
Boolin, rockin' all the Frank Muller
I know some hoes with good head, fuck a tutor
So many hundreds I done added, I'm going to lose 'em
Put me in the Jaggy or the Wraith and now I'm coolin'
Play with my money, I'ma let them niggas do you
Play with my money I'ma let them niggas do you
Play with my money I'ma let these niggas do you
Play with my money
Play with my, play with my money

I do maye, I do
I do maye, I do
I do maye, I do
I do maye, I do

Play around with my cash
End up in a body bag
In the store and then dash
Pull up, hoppin' out a cab
She know she got a nigga bad
She know she gotta keep me back
She know I gotta keep me some cash
She know she gotta hop on top the dick
She know you gotta ride that motherfucker
Her mama done walked in, but it's too big
She can't hide that motherfucker
Even if she divided the motherfucker
Man even if she minused the motherfucker
Join in get demolished motherfucker
I ain't gon' disguise it motherfucker, nah
Shop at Saks Fifth, flow on DatPiff
Yeah I'm that swift, ask her and him
Yeah ask 'em, put a bone in them
Put a choker on 'em, let 'em choke and all
All my jewelry small, yeah, they got it all
Daughter sexy and my son got the broads
Spent racks on my son and his squad
Daddy boy, never play with toys
Better not play with 'em boys
New AK with them boys
New feng shui with the boys
Drippin' all day for the boys
Bitch you ain't ready for the boys
I'm in that Wraith homeboy
If you ever play with the boy
I'ma turn the blade on 'em boys

I do lie, yeah, I do
I do lie, yeah, I do
I do lie, yeah, I do
I do lie, yeah, I do
