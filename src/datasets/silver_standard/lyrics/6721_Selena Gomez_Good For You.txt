I'm in my 14 carats, I'm 14 carat
Doing it up like Midas, mmm
Now you say I got a touch, so good, so good
Make you never wanna leave, so don't, so don't

Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to your heart beating

'Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you, uh-huh

I'm on my Marquise diamonds, I'm a Marquise diamond
Could even make that Tiffany jealous, mmm
You say I give it to you hard, so bad, so bad
Make you never wanna leave, I won't, I won't

Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to how you're breathing

'Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh

Trust me, I can take you there
Trust me, I can take you there
Trust me, I, trust me, I, trust me, I

Hold on, take a minute, love
'Cause I ain't trying to mess your image up
Like we mess around in triple cuffs
Stumble 'round town, pull your zipper up
Pants sag like I don't give a
I ain't trying to mess your fitness up
And I ain't trying to get you into stuff
But the way you touchin' on me in the club
Rubbin' on my miniature
John Hancock, the signature
Any time I here, I know she feelin' for it through
And any time we get our boys in up on the news
Ain't worried 'bout no press and ain't worried 'bout the next chick
They love the way you dress and ain't got shit up on you
Jackpot, hit the jackpot (whoo!)
Just made a bad miss without the ass shots (whoo!)
You look good, girl, you know you did good, don't you?
You look good, girl, bet it feel good, don't it?

I just wanna look good for you, good for you, uh-huh
Baby, let me be good to you, good to you, uh-huh
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Trust me, I, trust me, I, trust me, I
