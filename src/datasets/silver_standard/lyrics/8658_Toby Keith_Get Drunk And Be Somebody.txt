Yeah, the big boss man, he likes to crack that whip.
I ain't nothin' but a number on his time card slip.
I give him forty hours an' a piece ' my soul;
Puts me somewhere at the bottom of his Totem pole.
Hell, I don't even think he knows my name. 

Yeah, all week long, I'm a real nobody,
But I just punched out an' it's pay cheque Friday.
Weekend's here, good God Almighty:
I'm gonna get drunk an' be somebody, (Somebody.)
Yeah, yeah yeah. 

My baby cuts hair at a beauty boutique,
Just blowin' an' a-goin' till she's dead on her feet.
They walk right in an' sit right down,
She gives 'em what they want an' then she spins them around.
Hell, I don't even think they even know her name. 

All week long, she's a real nobody,
But I just picked her up an' it's pay cheque Friday.
Weekend's here, good God Almighty:
Baby, let's get drunk an' be somebody, (Somebody.)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

We're just average people in an every day bar.
Drivin' from work in our ordinary car.
An' I like to come here with regular Joes,
Drink all you want: be the star of the show.

All week long, a bunch of real nobodies,
But we just punched out an' it's pay cheque Friday.
Weekend's here, good God Almighty:
People, let's get drunk. (Let's get drunk.)

All week long, we're some real nobodies,
But we just punched out: it's pay cheque Friday.
Weekend's here, good God Almighty:
People, let's get drunk an' be somebody, (Let's get drunk.)
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
