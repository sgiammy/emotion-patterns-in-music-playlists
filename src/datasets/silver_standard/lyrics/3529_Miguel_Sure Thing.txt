Love you like a brother,
Treat you like a friend,
Respect you like a lover...
Ooh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh...

(You could bet that, never gotta sweat that...) Oh-oh, oh-oh...
(You could bet that, never gotta sweat that...) Yeah-yeah, yeah...
(You could bet that, never gotta sweat that...)
(You could bet that, never gotta sweat that...)

If you be the cash, I'll be the rubberband;
You be the match, I will be your fuse - boom...
Painter, baby, you could be the muse;
I'm the reporter, baby, you could be the news...

'Cause you're the cigarette, and I'm the smoker;
We raise the bet, 'cause you're the joker...
Chipped off, you are the chalk,
And I could be the blackboard, you can be the talk...
And I can be the walk, yeah...

Even when the sky comes fallin', even when the sun don't shine,
I got faith in you and I, so put your pretty little hand in mine...
Even when we're down to the wire, babe, even when it's do or die,
We can do it, baby, simple and plain, 'cause this love is a sure thing...

(You could bet that, never gotta sweat that...) Yeah, yeah...
(You could bet that, never gotta sweat that...)
(You could bet that, never gotta sweat that...)
(You could bet that, never gotta sweat that...)

You could be the lover, I'll be the fighter, baby;
If I'm the blunt (ah), you could be the lighter, babe - fire it up...
Writer, baby, you could be the quote; (Ah...)
If I'm the lyric, baby, you could be the note (ah), record that...

Saint, I'm a sinner (ah), prize, I'm a winner (ah),
And it's you, what did I do to deserve that?
Paper, baby, I'll be the pen;
Say I am the one, 'cause you are a ten...
It's real and not pretend...

Even when the sky comes fallin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...), even when the sun don't shine,
I got faith in you and I, so put your pretty little hand in mine...
Even when we're down to the wire, baby, even when it's do or die,
(You could bet that, never gotta sweat that... you could bet that, never gotta sweat that...)
We can do it, baby, simple and plain, 'cause this love is a sure thing...
(You could bet that, never gotta sweat that... you could bet that, never gotta sweat that...)

And rock with me, babe...
Let me hold you in my arms, talk with me, babe, yeah...
And rock with me, baby...
Let me hold you in my arms, talk with me, babe, yeah...

This love between you and I is simple as pie, baby;
(It's such a sure thing, it's such a sure thing,) Oh, it's such a sure thing...
(It's such a sure thing, it's such a sure thing...) Yeah, yeah...

Even when the sky comes fallin', even when the sun don't shine,
(You could bet that, never gotta sweat that... you could bet that, never gotta sweat that...)
I got faith in you and I, so put your pretty little hand in mine...
(You could bet that, never gotta sweat that... you could bet that, never gotta sweat that...)
Even when we're down to the wire, babe, even when it's do or die,
(You could bet that, never gotta sweat that... you could bet that, never gotta sweat that...)
We can do it, baby, simple and plain, 'cause this love is a sure thing...
(You could bet that, never gotta sweat that... you could bet that, never gotta sweat that...)

Love you like a brother,
(You could bet that, never gotta sweat that...)
Treat you like a friend...
(You could bet that, never gotta sweat that...)
Respect you like a lover;
(You could bet that, never gotta sweat that...)
Ooh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh...
(You could bet that, never gotta sweat that...)
