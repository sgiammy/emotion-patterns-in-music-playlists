I got all this love, waiting just for you
I just gotta know that your love is true
Can't keep running boy in and out my life
Wanna be your girl, not cause the mood is right

If I let you come inside, tomorrow will you hide
Will you be there for me, when I need someone to hold me
Baby don't misunderstand, I do want for my man
I just need a little time, before I invest my love

Don't walk away boy (Don't walk away) my love won't hurt you
Don't walk away boy (Don't walk away) I'll be right there for you
Don't walk away boy (Don't walk away) my love won't hurt you
Don't walk away boy (Don't walk away) I'll be right there for you

I'll be right there for you

I've got all this love, all this love, waiting just for you, just for you
I've got all this love, all this love, waiting just for you, just for you

I've got all this love, all this love, waiting just for you, just for you

I've got all this love, all this love
Don't walk away boy (Don't walk away) my love won't hurt you
Don't walk away boy (Don't walk away) I'll be right there for you
Don't walk away boy (Don't walk away) my love won't hurt you
Don't walk away boy (Don't walk away) I'll be right there for you

I'll be right there for you
