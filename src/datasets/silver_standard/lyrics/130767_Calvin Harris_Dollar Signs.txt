Dollar signs
Said fuck this shit, you know what's on my mind
Stay on your hustle, you be on your grind
Rip out your heart and left it on the line
You running out of time
You lose your mind you lose your fucking mind
You lose your mind you lose your fucking mind
You close your eyes, you seeing dollar signs, dollar signs

Dollar signs
I told you once ain't gotta tell you twice
If life's a game I'm throwing loaded dice
These other girls ain't really what you like, what you like
Feeling like running away
Stressing bout nothing all day
Money and hoes, come and they go
Let them go fuck em away
Everything ain't what it seems if it's all just a dream
I believe it, I believe it

Love is something vicious
Still it isn't right
Seeing all them secrets in your eyes
Meet me in the middle underneath the lights
You know I ain't got no chill tonight

No chill, no chill no
Got no chill tonight

No chill, no chill no
Got no chill tonight

No chill, no chill no
Got no chill tonight

No chill, no chill no
Got no chill tonight
