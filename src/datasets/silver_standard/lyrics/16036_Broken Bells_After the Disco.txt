After your faith has let you down
I know you'll want to run around
And follow the crowd into the night
But after the disco all of the shine just faded away

Do what you want, do what you will
Don't tell me it's not our time
'Cause I'm waiting here much too long
And don't assume that I need your love

The chill of night has got you dancing away
And I'm not the dreamer
Oh, I ought to dream all that you're looking for

How did I get in this winding maze of love
And there's something wrong, girl
It's sending you round and round till we go nowhere

I see the ashes on the ground
Another world is burning down
And under the cold and empty moon
But after the disco all of the shine just faded away

Do what you want, do what you will
But you can't hide
Do what you want do what you will
Don't tell me it's not our time
'Cause I'm waiting here much too long
And don't assume that I need your love

This chill of night has got you dancing away
And I'm not the dreamer
Oh, I ought to dream all that you're looking for

How did I get in this winding maze of love
And there's something wrong, girl
It's sending you round and round till we go nowhere
