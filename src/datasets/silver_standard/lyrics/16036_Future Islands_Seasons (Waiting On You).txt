Seasons change
And I tried hard just to soften you
And seasons change
But I've grown tired of tryin' to change for you

'Cause I've been waiting on you
I've been waiting on you
'Cause I've been waiting on you
I've been waiting on you

As it breaks, the summer will wake
But the winter will wash what is left, of the taste
As it breaks, the summer will warm
But the winter will crave what' gone
Crave what has all gone away

People change
But you know some people never do
You know when people change
They gain a peace but they lose one too

'Cause I've been hanging on you
I've been waiting on you
'Cause I've been waiting on you
I've been hanging on you

As it breaks, the summer will wake
But the winter will wash what is left, of the taste
As it breaks, the summer will warm
But the winter will crave what's gone
Crave what is gone, crave what has all gone away

'Cause I've been waiting on you
