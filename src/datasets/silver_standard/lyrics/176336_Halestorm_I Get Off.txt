You don't know that I know you watch me every night
And I just can't resist the urge to stand here in the light
Your greedy eyes upon me and then I come undone
And I could close the curtain but this is too much fun

I get off on you gettin' off on me
Give you what you want but nothin' is for free
It's a give and take kind of love we make
When your line is crossed, I get off

I get off

There's so much left unspoken between the two of us
It's so much more exciting to look when you can't touch
You could say I'm different and maybe I'm a freak
But I know how to twist ya, to bring you to your knees

I get off on you gettin' off on me
Give you what you want but nothin' is for free
It's a give and take kind of love we make
When your line is crossed, I get off

I get off

What you don't know, what you can't see
Is what I do for you I do for me

I get off on you gettin' off on me
I give you what you want, yeah

I get off on you gettin' off on me
Give you what you want but nothin' is for free
It's a give and take kind of love we make
When your line is crossed, I get off

Yeah, I get off
Yeah, I get off
Yeah, I get off
