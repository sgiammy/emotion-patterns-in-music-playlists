Damn I hate being sober, I'm a smoker
Fredo a drinker, Tadoe off molly water
We can't spell sober
But I roll up, when we roll up bitches be on us
So the lot smoking and I'm drinking
It takes over for no reason
'Cause we can't spell sober
Ya know us, we smoke strong bruh, watch me roll up
'Cause I can't spell sober

On my tour bus we get dumb high you's a floor, bruh
Fredo got a hangover he toting a Cobra
Last night he was shooting shit up like O-Dog
Reese roll up, Tadoe got hoes on mollies
Chief Sosa ball out we high riding 'Rari's
My bitches love drinking, Sosa loves smoking
Let my alcoholic bitch hit the dope, she start choking
Call up D-Money, now we throw money
All these bitches off the shits walk around like some zombies
Call up D-Money, now we throw money
All these bitches off the shits walk around like some zombies

Damn I hate being sober, I'm a smoker
Fredo a drinker, Tadoe off molly water
We can't spell sober
But I roll up, when we roll up bitches be on us
So the lot smoking and I'm drinking
It takes over for no reason
'Cause we can't spell sober
Ya know us, we smoke strong bruh, watch me roll up
'Cause I can't spell sober

We got 100 pounds of this shit, my stash house with them bricks
My pockets filled with them stacks, my bitch be going for flat
She a hot tamale when she pop a molly, it's time to party, we part hard
Drink and smoke it, drink and smoke it, drink and smoke it, we out for sure

My weed so strong, my cheese so long
Roll so many joints soon I might need a loan
Spend so many grands that I might need some bands
That's your bitch why she acting like she need a man?
I'm faded, talking mills 'cause I made it
Talking pounds 'cause I smoke it
Talking game 'cause I played it
I'm wasted, Rose that's my favorite
OG kush the good tastin',
Buying Cris' by the cases
I hate being sober
Don't smell no one smoking
Me and my niggas come roll up
Believe they gon' fire on you
You think you could roll up
You smoke by the ounce
Well bitch, I smoke by the pound 'cause
