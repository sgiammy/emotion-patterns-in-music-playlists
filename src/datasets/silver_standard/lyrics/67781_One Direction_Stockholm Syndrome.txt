Who's that shadow holding me hostage?
I've been here for days
Who's this whisper telling me that I'm
Never gonna get away?

I know they'll be coming
To find me soon
But I fear I'm getting
Used to being held by you

Baby look what you've done to me
Baby look what you've done now
Baby I'll never leave
If you keep holding me this way
Baby look what you've done to me
Baby you've got me tied down
Baby I'll never leave
If you keep holding me this way

Who's this man that's holding your hand
And talking 'bout your eyes
Used to sing about being free but
Now he's changed his mind

I know they'll be coming
To find me soon
But my Stockholm syndrome
Is in your room
Yeah I fell for you!

Baby look what you've done to me
Baby look what you've done now
Baby I'll never leave
If you keep holding me this way
Baby look what you've done to me
Baby you've got me tied down
Baby I'll never leave
If you keep holding me this way

All my life I've been on my own
I used the light to guide me home
And now together we're alone
And there's no other place I'd ever wanna go

Look what you've done to me
Baby look what you've done, done
Baby look what you've done to me
Baby look what you've done now
Baby I'll never leave
If you keep holding me this way
Baby look what you've done to me
Baby you've got me tied down
Baby I'll never leave
If you keep holding me this way
