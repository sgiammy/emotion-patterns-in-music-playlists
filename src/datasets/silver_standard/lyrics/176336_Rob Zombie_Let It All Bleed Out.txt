Bleed
Bleed
Bleed it out
Yeah!

A rat on the scraps
Jaws to the fossil
Turn into conventional man, yeah!
(Conventional man, yeah!)
(Conventional man, yeah!)
(Conventional man, yeah!)

Persistance of the system
Acccumulate collection
Like a hype show on the surface
(On the surface)
(On the surface)
(On the surface)

Let it all bleed out 
Let it all bleed out
Let it all bleed out
Let it all bleed out!
(Bleed out!)

High status freaks
Grandize and screaming
I'm a major, prince, squire and king, yeah!
(Squire and king, yeah!)
(Squire and king, yeah!)
(Squire and king, yeah!)

Black tie appearance
Circus roles for nothing
All the odd ones leave'em screaming
(Leave'em screaming)
(Leave'em screaming)
(Leave'em screaming)

Let it all bleed out 
Let it all bleed out
Let it all bleed out
Let it all bleed out!
(Bleed out!)

(Let it all
Let it all
Let it all bleed out)

Bleed, bleed, bleed it out, yeah!
Bleed, bleed, bleed it out, yeah!

A rat on the scraps
Jaws to the fossil
Turn into conventional man, yeah!
(Conventional man, yeah!)
(Conventional man, yeah!)
(Conventional man, yeah!)

Persistance of the system
Acccumulate collection
Like a hype show on the surface
(On the surface)
(On the surface)

Let it all bleed out 
Let it all bleed out
Let it all bleed out
Let it all bleed out!
(Bleed out!)
