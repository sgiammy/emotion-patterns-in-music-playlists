Know some young niggas like to swang
Know some young niggas like to swang
Big bank take little bank
Everyday spillin' up drank
She want the whole crew, shawty brave
When the money talks, what is there to say?
Blow away, watch it blow away
When I die can't take it to the grave
Hop out, drop, top, fuck y'all talkin' I need it right now
Cash in the air, yeah, what goes up gotta come down

Gettin' dough ain't a thing change
Coasting, grippin' grain
Goin' through the money like a phase
Don't say my name in vain
I'm so glad that you came
All these bad bitches gettin' slain
Broke ass nigga get a clue
All these niggas know how we do

Know some young niggas like to swang
Know some young niggas like to swang
Big bank take little bank
Everyday spillin' up drank
She want the whole crew, shawty brave
When the money talks, what is there to say?
Blow away, watch it blow away
When I die can't take it to the grave
Hop out, drop, top, fuck y'all talkin' I need it right now
Cash in the air, yeah, what goes up gotta come down

I know some young niggas from the bottom
They'll do anything for a dollar
I coulda went to school to be a doctor
But I dropped out and chose to be a baller
Switchin' lanes, spittin' game in my new drop
Still on a paper chase that don't ever stop
Everybody with me family, that's how we rock
Party at the mansion, we bout to flood the spot
SremmLife!
