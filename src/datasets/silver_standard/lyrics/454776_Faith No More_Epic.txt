Can you feel it, see it, hear it today?
If you can't, then it doesn't matter anyway
You will never understand it, 'cause it happens too fast
And it feels so good, it's like walking on glass

It's so cool, it's so hip, it's alright
It's so groovy, it's outta sight
You can touch it, smell it, taste it, so sweet
But it makes no difference 'cause it knocks you off your feet

You want it all, but you can't have it
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

It's cryin', bleedin', lyin' on the floor
So you lay down on it and you do it some more
You've got to share it, so you dare it
Then you bare it and you tear it

You want it all, but you can't have it
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's in your face but you can't grab it
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

It's alive, afraid, a lie, a sin
It's magic, it's tragic, it's a loss, it's a win
It's dark, it's moist, it's a bitter pain
It's sad, it happened and it's a shame

You want it all, but you can't have it
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's in your face, but you can't grab it

What is it?
(It's it) What is it?
(It's it) What is it?
(It's it) What is it?
(It's it)

What is it?
(It's it) What is it?
(It's it) What is it?
(It's it) What is it?

You want it all, but you can't have it
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's in your face but you can't grab it
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

(It's it) What is it?
(It's it) What is it?
(It's it) What is it?
(It's it) (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

(It's it) What is it?
(It's it) What is it?
(It's it) What is it?
(It's it) (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

(It's it) What is it?
(It's it) What is it?
(It's it) What is it?
(It's it) (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

(It's it) What is it?
(It's it) What is it?
(It's it) What is it?
(It's it) (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
