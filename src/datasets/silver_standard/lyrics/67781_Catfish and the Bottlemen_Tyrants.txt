Eyes rolled back, guess we were living fast
Where did it go, yeah where did you go?
Your eyes go to show
That it was so rare to see you sober
And so the streetlights would carry us home

And I spent my nights trying to get a grip of you
And I did my best to get my hands on your jacket
So we could make a racket
But your divine ribs would help break mine
We hit ground, so let's hit the ground

She said nothing's alright, believe me
I won't feel the same in the mornin'
She said nothing's alright, we're leavin'
And I won't feel the same in the mornin'

And darling I know that I've done wrong
And I know I should've come home to you
And I know that I've done wrong
And I know I should've come home to you

Tyrants help build us
They won't mind throwin' us away
Tyrants help build us
They won't mind throwin' us away

Tyrants help build us
They won't mind throwin' us away
The tyrants help build us
And they won't mind throwin' us away
