Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts

Every night I cry
Every night I sigh
Every night I wonder why
You treat me cold
Yet you won't let me go

Every little hurt counts
Every little hurt counts

You say you're coming home
Yet you never phone
Leave me all alone
My love is strong for you
I'd do wrong for you

I can't take this
Loneliness you've given me
I can't go on
Giving my life away

Oh, come back to me
Darling, you'll see
I can give you all the
Things that you wanted before
If you will stay with me, yeah

Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts

To you, I'm a toy
And you're the boy
Who has to say
When I should play
Yet you hurt me, desert me

Come back to me
Darling, you'll see
I can give you all the
Things that you wanted before
If you will stay with me, yeah

Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts
