Bands a make her dance 
Bands a make her dance
Bands a make her dance
Bands a make her dance 
Bands a make her dance
Bands a make her dance

Bands a make her dance, bands a make her dance
All these chicks popping pussies, I'm just popping bands
Bands a make her dance, bands a make her dance
These chicks clappin', and they ain't using hands

Short hair like Nia Long, loose one, she don't need it long
She start twerking when she hear a song, the strippper pole her income
We get trippy and then some, so nasty when she rolling
She put that ass off in my hands, I remote control it

She give me dome when the roof gone, at the KOD she live with me
She got friends, bring three, I got drugs, I got drinks
Bend it over, Juicy J gon' poke it like wet paint
You say no to ratchet pussy, Juicy J can't

Racks everywhere, they're showing racks I'm throwing racks
In the VIP, rubber on, I'm stretching it
Bitch niggas tippin', broke niggas looking
And it ain't a strip club if they ain't showing pussy.

Bands a make her dance, bands a make her dance
All these chicks popping pussies, I'm just popping bands
Bands a make her dance, bands a make her dance
These chicks clappin', and they ain't using hands.

Down in Atlanta, about to hit up magic
Throw some money in the air all the bad bitches gon' grab it
Straight off the floor she gonna need a couple of bags
Like a broke ATM, imma spillin' all this cash

Them niggas in the club don't be spending shit
Twenty stacks in one night, I be on trippy shit
My crib's paid off, but I'm still paying rent
A couple of condos paid, she loving every cent

She make that ass clap dancing like she on a dick
Bring it back I threw a stack, that's a lucky bitch
Up and down, she's going, she's sliding on that pole
Making money, stacking up hundreds, shawty cold

Bands a make her dance, bands a make her dance
All these chicks popping pussies, I'm just popping bands
Bands a make her dance, bands a make her dance
These chicks clappin', and they ain't using hands
