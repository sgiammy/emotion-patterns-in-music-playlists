I did my best to notice
When the call came down the line
Up to the platform of surrender
I was brought, but I was kind

And sometimes I get nervous
When I see an open door
Close your eyes, clear your heart
Cut the cord

Are we human, or are we dancer?
My sign is vital; my hands are cold
And I'm on my knees looking for the answer
Are we human, or are we dancer?

Pay my respects to grace and virtue
Send my condolences to good
Give my regards to soul and romance
They always did the best they could

And so long to devotion
You taught me everything I know
Wave goodbye, wish me well
You've gotta let me go

Are we human, or are we dancer?
My sign is vital; my hands are cold
And I'm on my knees looking for the answer
Are we human, or are we dancer?

Will your system be alright
When you dream of home tonight?
There is no message we're receiving
Let me know, is your heart still beating?

Are we human, or are we dancer?
My sign is vital; my hands are cold
And I'm on my knees looking for the answer

You've gotta let me know

Are we human, or are we dancer?
My sign is vital; my hands are cold
And I'm on my knees looking for the answer
Are we human, or are we dancer?

Are we human, or are we dancer?
Are we human, or are we dancer?
