Money hoes cars & clothes

Blowin' dro on 24's
That's how all my niggas roll

We in a drop top Chevy with the roof wide open.
My partner's lookin' at me to see if my eyes open
'Cause I've been drankin' & I've been smokin'
& flyin' down 285, but I'm focused.
It's a 454 SS, I race Porsches.
White leather seats as fresh as Air Forces.
I say I'm doin' 'bout 100 but the track still bumpin'
Number 8 on NWA "Straight Outta Compton."
Pull up at your apartment sittin' on 20 somethin's
& the dope boys holla "What's happenin'?" the kids running in.
The cliques start dancin' & the broads start choosin'
& the cars been parked, but the rims keep movin'.
Sign pictures, by an onion of good & throw the deuces.
I ain't Hollywood, I come from the hood, I'm use to it.
So if your rear view shakin' & your seats vibratin'
24 inch J's got the chevrolet skatin' makin'...

I made a million & I'm satisfied, I'll get the rest.
& a civilian in the tightest ride, I want the best.
I refuse to get a 9 to 5, I'd rather flip my keys.
Been payin' my dues since '89 tryin' to get my cheese.
Diamonds gleam when I'm on the scene, they know it's me.
Ain't no dream or no fantasy bitch, it's T.I.P.
Broad buffin, like a baby do a binky
5 karat VVS's on my muthafuckin' pinkie.
Half of Hennessey & Belvedere what we drankin'.
Pimps score ourself a broad what the hell you niggas thinkin'?
Y'all niggas spend a weekend in the islands in the fall
24's be shinin' when I'm ridin' 'cause I'm ballin'.
I'm callin' out shots like a pool shark.
My tool sparks in the dark when I fool marks.
Y'all fool hearts in the wrong place & the wrong time.
I gotta strong mind to grab my chrome 9 & shoot at your ass for a long time.
But I'm'a get that ass hauled off.
Fuck around with the clique
They'll be lookin' for your dick with a stick
Nigga y'all soft, so y'all off.
I'm'a ball at all costs, spit game to a dame
Look around this thing 'til she falls off.
Some balls off, I got the...

I ain't flossin' little shawty, I'm relaxin' right now.
I'd probably still be trappin' if I wasn't rappin' right now.
Braggin' about pistols at the house.
Strap right now.
Keep on talkin' folk, I'll lay you on your back right now.
Wanna act right now? Get smacked right now?
Hey I'm above a muthafucker, I don't know to back down
Clown down, we're makin' friends; talkin' about what you makin' nothin'.
I'm 21 & 10 years deep, that shit to me ain't nothin'.
Played by the niggas gettin' head for a change,
Use the lead when I spray, end up dead from the K.
They ain't ready for the raid, pay heavy from the yay
I told the class "kiss my ass" I make 11 everyday.
I'm gettin'...
