Who do you love?
I wanna know, I wanna know
Who do you love?
I wanna know, I wanna know

Where did you go
When you kissed me good-night
You didn't walk home
The same way you did last-night

Where did you go?
I wanna know, I wanna know
Where did you go?
I wanna know, I wanna know

You were dancing with me
But I saw you flirting with her
Were all the pretty words you whispered to me
Meant for her, meant for her?

So tell me
Who do you love?
I wanna know, I wanna know
Who do you love?
I wanna know, I wanna know

Mama said, you were bad
Mama said, you were bad
Mama said, you were bad
Mama said, you were bad

And I should leave you alone
You had a playboy's reputation
With all the girls you know
So I got to know

Just where I belong?
Am I just another girl?
Are you leading me on?
Leading me on

So tell me
Who do you love?
I wanna know, I wanna know
Who do you love?
I wanna know I wanna know

Who do you love?
I wanna know, I wanna know
Who do you love?
I wanna know I wanna know

Who do you love?
I wanna know, I wanna know
Who do you love?
I wanna know I wanna know
