I wish I could be there
See you everyday
I don't have to call you
I don't have a lot
But you got to see my life
Pretty sure you were gone ahead

Do you think we did it right
You weren't lying when you said just
Wait till you live with someone someday
Some days slip right by me
And I think I know why
I make it through

It's imperfect
It's not forever
That you're further
You're still patient

It's imperfect
It's not forever
That you're further
You're still patient

It's imperfect
It's not forever
That you're further
You're still patient

It's imperfect
It's not forever
That you're further
You're still patient

It's imperfect
It's not forever

Some days you find me
And I think I know why
I'll make it through
