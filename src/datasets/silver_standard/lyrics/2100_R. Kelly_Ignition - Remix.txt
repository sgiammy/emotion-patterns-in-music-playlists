Now, usually I don't do this but uh
Go ahead and break 'em off a little preview of the remix

Now I'm not tryin' ta be rude but hey pretty girl I'm feelin' you
The way you do the things you do reminds me of my E Lexus Coup
That's why I'm all up in your grill tryna getcha to a hotel
You must be a football coach the way you got me playin' the field

So baby give me that (toot toot) and let me give ya that (beep beep)
Runnin' her hands through my 'fro bouncin' on 24's 
While they're sayin' on the radio

It's the remix to Ignition hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin' that body got every man in here wishin'
Sippin' on Coke and rum I'm like so what I'm drunk
It's the freakin' weekend baby I'm about to have me some fun

Bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce
Bounce bounce bounce
C'mon 

It's like "Murder She Wrote" once I get you out them clothes
Privacy is on the door still they can hear ya screamin' more 
Girl I'm feeling what you're feelin' no more hopin' and wishin' 
I'm about to take my key and stick it in the ignition 

So baby give me that (toot toot) and let me give ya that (beep beep)
Runnin' her hands through my 'fro bouncin' on 24's 
While they're sayin' on the radio

It's the remix to Ignition hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin' that body got every man in here wishin'
Sippin' on Coke and rum I'm like so what I'm drunk
It's the freakin' weekend baby I'm about to have me some fun

Cristal poppin' in the stretch Navigator 
They got food everywhere as if the party was catered 
I got fellas to my left and honeys to my right
We bring them both together and we got jukin' all night 
Then after the show it's the after party (yeah) 
And after the party it's the hotel lobby (yeah)
And around about 4 you gotta clear the lobby
Then take it to your room and somebody 

Can I get a (toot toot) can I get a (beep beep)
Runnin' her hands through my 'fro bouncin' on 24's 
While they're sayin' on the radio

It's the remix to Ignition hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin' that body got every man in here wishin'
Sippin' on Coke and rum I'm like so what I'm drunk
It's the freakin' weekend baby I'm about to have me some fun

It's the remix to Ignition hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin' that body got every man in here wishin'
Sippin' on Coke and rum I'm like so what I'm drunk
It's the freakin' weekend baby I'm about to have me some fun

Girl we off in the this jeep foggin' windows up
Blastin' the radio in the back of my truck
Bouncin' up and down stroke it round and round
To the re-mix we just buggin' out
