I lost my heart, my home is the ocean
The waves underneath will soon be my home
I will fall asleep (Fall asleep)
I'll close my eyes and dream of days when I wasn't all alone

All that I know is gone
(Take what is left of me now)
All that I know is gone
(Take what is left of me)

Fall deeper and deeper
The sirens are singing your songs
(The sirens are singing your songs)

I'll miss my breath, there's no more left
I'll miss the sound of the wind at my back
The depths have a number; they call you by name

Fall asleep, Davy Jones calls you
So fall asleep, fall asleep and dream

All that I know is gone
(Take what is left of me now)
All that I know is gone
(Take what is left of me)

Fall deeper and deeper
The sirens are singing your songs
(The sirens are singing your songs)

All that I know is gone
(Take what is left of me now)
All that I know is gone
(Take what is left of me)

Fall deeper and deeper
The sirens are singing your songs
(The sirens are singing your songs)
