I got strung up from our loving 
I wish you cared to see 
But she only cares when she's got the time 
And I fret so much about our loving 
I wish she let me be 
But our destiny got us intertwined 

And is it really my fault? 
I get a shiver when I see you with those other guys 
Wearing the jacket I bought 
I can't help but lose my temper and I don't know why 

I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it 
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it 
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it 
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it 
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it 
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it 
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it 
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it 

What is she thinking? Too much uncertainty 
Why can't she give some sort of sign? 
You know and I know, a thing or two about loyalty 
Ooh, but that girl don't pay no mind

So is it really my fault? 
I get a shiver when I see you with those other guys 
Wearing the jacket I bought 
I can't help but lose my temper and I don't know why 

I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it 
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it 
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it 
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it 
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it 
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it 
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it 
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it 

I get strung up from her loving 
I wish she cared to see 
But she only cares when she so inclined 
And I fret so much about her loving 
I wish she'd let me be 
But her destiny got us so intertwined 
Back in 2011, I decided 
To not let this play with my mind 
But when them boys from out of town 
They come back around 
I feel like committing a crime, yeah 

I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it 
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it 
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it 
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it 
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it 
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it 
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it 
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it
