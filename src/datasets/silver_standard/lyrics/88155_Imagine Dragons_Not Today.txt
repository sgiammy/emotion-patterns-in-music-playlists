There she goes in front of me
Take my life and set me free again
We'll make a memory out of it
Holy road is at my back
Don't look on, take me back again
We'll make a memory out of it

We finally fall apart and we break each other's hearts
If we wanna live young, love, we better start today

It's gotta get easier, oh easier somehow
'Cause I'm falling, I'm falling
Oh easier and easier somehow
Oh I'm calling, I'm calling
And it isn't over unless it is over
I don't wanna wait for that
It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
But not today
Not today

There she goes in front of me
Take my life, set me free again
We'll make a memory out of it
Holy road was at my back
Don't look on, take me back again
We'll make a memory out of it

We finally fall apart and we break each other's hearts
If we wanna live young, love, we better start today

It's gotta get easier, oh easier somehow
'Cause I'm falling, I'm falling
Oh easier and easier somehow
Oh I'm calling, I'm calling
And it isn't over unless it is over
I don't wanna wait for that
It's gotta get easier and easier

So come with me
You'll come with me-ey
So come with me
You'll come with me-ey
Not today
Not today
Not today
Not today

It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
'Cause I'm falling, I'm falling
And easier and easier somehow
Oh I'm calling and calling
And it isn't over unless it is over
I don't wanna wait for that
It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
Not today
Not today
Not today
Not today
Not today
