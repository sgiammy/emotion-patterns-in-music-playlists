All about it, all about it, I'll tell you all about it, all about it

This the shit you play when you in a Bentley truck
This the shit you play when them strippers acting up
This the shit you play when you smoke a zip and up
This the shit you play when you sippin' out a cup
This the shit you play nigga (yessir). This the shit you play (all right)
This the shit you play when you cuttin' up that work
This the shit you play when you ridin' in a vert
This the shit you play when you in a Bentley truck
This the shit you play when them strippers acting up
This the shit you play when you smoke a zip and up
This the shit you play when you sippin' out a cup

Stunt. Dab. Thrab. Racks
Ball hog. Neiman's, Saks
Lenox, Moda, Dope, Soda
Lean, Soda, Cream, Soda
Shawdy thick, small waist
Fat ass, gon' shake
Money tall, Tyra Banks
We everything y'all ain't
Couldn't believe in Santa Claus 'cause I ain't have no chimney
Soufside with a F and the F for Fendi
I'm the type of guy to buy a extra Bentley
Had 2 SS's like Mississippi
One phone call and I can get some pussy
One phone call, I know you niggas pussy
This the shit you play when you in the bushes
This the shit you play when you hit the bookie

This the shit you play when you in a Bentley truck
This the shit you play when them strippers acting up
This the shit you play when you smoke a zip and up
This the shit you play when you sippin' out a cup
This the shit you play when you in a Bentley truck
This the shit you play when them strippers acting up
This the shit you play when you smoke a zip and up
This the shit you play when you sippin' out a cup

This that shit you play, 'bout that pistol play
Bop-bop bitch your face, haha in your face
This that shit you know, bitch you know you fake
This that clique you hate, but bitch they're here to stay
This that shit you play, this that clique you know
'Bout that trigger play, trigger finger roll
But this ain't NBA, this the CEO
And this ain't MMA, but this a TKO
Rolls Royce Wraith, I park that bitch and skate
I talk that shit, she caught that line, I call that fish filet
And all of my niggas is a-one, and y'all lil niggas look like steak (well done)
And all my woes is athletic, and all of my hoes is getting pregnant
Don't dab, don't dance
Do me, own swag
Never soft, you niggas softer
What's that smell? Rigor mortis
South Beach, socks off
Money, drugs in the sock drawer
Fuck her good, get a round of applause
This the shit I play when I go to drop a bitch off

This the shit you play when you in a Bentley truck
This the shit you play when them strippers acting up
This the shit you play when you smoke a zip and up
This the shit you play when you sippin' out a cup
This the shit you play when you in a Bentley truck
This the shit you play when them strippers acting up
This the shit you play when you smoke a zip and up
