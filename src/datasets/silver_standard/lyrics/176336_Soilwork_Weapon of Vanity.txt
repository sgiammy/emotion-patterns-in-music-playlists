They play divine as immortal sons
Pulling triggers and then they switch and run
As long as you have nothing to add
They run the show
How can you get a single shot with a life like that?
Now will you ever conclude as it turns to a lack?

Deceive it, believe it
Do you feel it flow?

As a weapon of your vanity

They crave for a soul-aching desire
Won't you play with me?
As time's standing still they've praised a liar

So now let me get a single minute of your precious time
So how do you feel now as the vanity is easy to find?

Deceive it, believe it
Do you feel it grow?

They crave for a soul-aching desire
Won't you play with me?
As time's standing still they've praised a liar

I swear, you're nothing like me
And it will never set you free
You won't be able to be down there alone
They'll fill you up till you're ripped and torn
Your life is out there for disposal
Knocked out before you're ready to leave
'Cause I swear you're nothing like me

As I reckon your insanity

They crave for a soul-aching desire
Won't you play with me?
As time's standing still they've praised a liar
They crave for a soul-aching desire
Won't you play with me?
As time's standing still they've praised a liar
