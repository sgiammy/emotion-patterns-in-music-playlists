I feel like Superman
They gonna remember me
I think I know I can
Who says it's hard to reach?
Who's gonna stop me on the road to success?
I don't know

They tried to break me down
But I'm still on my feet
This city's full of life
So why is it hard to breathe?
Oh why did God create this world so unfair?
I don't know

Sometimes I feel like I can't run, I can't crawl
And sometimes I feel like I ain't nothing at all
Life is a journey where you stumble and fall
But I'm okay

When I lie down in your arms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

When I lie down in your arms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

When I lie down in your arms

I feel like moving back
Sometimes it's hard to dream
The life I chose is past
It's moving without me
Who doesn't want a machine so they can go back in time?
I don't know

My time went by too fast
There's no one left but me
I've got a nine to five
And it gets the best of me
This is the life I'm gonna live to the end
But I'm okay

When I lie down in your arms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

When I lie down in your arms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

When I lie down in your arms

Sometimes I feel like I can't run, I can't crawl
And sometimes I feel like I ain't nothing at all
Life is a journey where you stumble and fall
But I'm okay

When I lie down in your arms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

When I lie down in your arms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

When I lie down in your arms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

When I lie down in your arms
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

When I lie down in your arms
