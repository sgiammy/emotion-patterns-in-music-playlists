Everyone's around
No words are coming now
And I can't find my breath.
Can we just say the rest with no sound?

And I know this isn't enough,
I still don't measure up
And I'm not prepared;
Sorry is never there when you need it

And I do want you to know
I'll hold you up above everyone
And I do want you to know
I think you'd be good to me
And I'd be so good to you

I would

I thought I saw a sign
Somewhere between the lines
But maybe it's me
Maybe I only see what I want

Or I still have your letter
Just got caught between
Someone I just invented
Who I really am and who
I've become

And I do want you to know
I'll hold you up above everyone
And I do want you to know
I think you'd be good to me
And I'd be so good to you

Whoa oh...

Yeah
Yeah

I would

And now I do want you to know
I'll hold you up above everyone
And I do want you to know
I think you'd be good to me
And I'd be so good to you

I'd be good to you
I'd be good to you
I'd be good to you (I'd be so good to you)
I'd be good to you
I'd be good to you
I'd be good to you (I'd be so good to you)
