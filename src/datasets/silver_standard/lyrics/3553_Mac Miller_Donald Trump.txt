Hey!
Ay-yo, sup? What's good, brah?
This man's kinda high over here
(Laugh)

Ay-yo the flyest motherfucker in the room yeah you know it's me
Bitches hatin' on him 'cause he started out here locally
Hopefully, I'll be at the top soon for now I'm at my house on the couch watchin' cartoon,
You know how much you love it when you get it in abundance
Give a fuck about a budget when you always be the subject of discussion
But it's nothin' when you stop and just say fuck it cause you walkin' out in public, and you hear 'em talkin' rubbish
I just wanna ride. Ride through the city in a cutlass
Find a big butt bitch somewhere get my nuts kissed that's the way it goes when you party just like I do
Bitches on my dick that used to brush me off in high school

Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money, ain't that some shit?

Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money, ain't that some shit?

We gon take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
That's why all my bitches bad they see this crazy life I have
And they in awe we gon win you can take the lose or draw
What I'm in got these hoes who used to play me and they broads
We gon take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
Take over the world watch these haters get mad
That's why all my bitches bad they see this crazy life I have hop into the car
And then we take 'em to the pad, it's a wrap

And motherfuckers think they know me but they never met the kid
Style come with excellence and money made benevolence irrelevant for the fuckers who never been intelligent
I kill my henny break the bottle for the hell of it
Tell a bitch that she better bring a friend
And if she want an autograph she better bring a pen
Yeah, the party'll never end
This life is what I recommend
And if you got a hoe to pull me then she better be a 10
I ain't picky but these girls be actin' tricky when the situations sticky and the liquor got'em silly

But I take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money, ain't that some shit?

We gon take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
That's why all my bitches bad they see this crazy life I have
And they in awe we gon win you can take the lose or draw
What I'm in got these hoes who used to play me and they broads
We gon take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
Take over the world watch these haters get mad
That's why all my bitches bad they see this crazy life I have hop into the car
And then we take 'em to the pad, it's a wrap
