It's your anniversary isn't it
And your man ain't acting right
So you packin' your Damier luggage up
Callin' my cell phone, tryin' catch a flight
You know one thing straight,
I'll be there girl whenever you call me
When you at home that's your man,
Soon as you land you say that's all me
'Cause shit ain't all G with him no more, you ain't entertained
Since I meet you a couple months ago you ain't been the same
Not sayin' I'm the richest man alive but I'm in the game
As long as you keep it one hundred Imma spend this change

Whenever you need me
Whenever want me,
You know you can call me, I'll be there shortly
Don't care what your friends say, 'cause they don't know me
I can be your best friend, and you be my homie
I ain't gon' flex, I'm not gon' front
You know if I ball, then we all gon' stunt
Send her my way, she ain't gotta hold up
Whenever you call baby I roll up, I roll up, I roll up
Whenever you call baby I roll up, I roll up, I roll up
Whenever you call baby I roll up

I try to stay out your business
But on the real you're so obvious
And if you keep fitting me in your plans and fuckin' up,
Your man's gonna catch onto us
That white sand surrounding us
He be handcuffing, he should work for them officers
If you rolling I got a spot
Where I can put you on this medical,
And send you home doctored up
You wanna ride with me 'cause you say that he boring
Wake up you rollin' weed, cooking eggs in the morning
Ain't scared to spend this money I'll make more of it
First you was in the sky now you say you in orbit

Whenever you need me
Whenever want me,
You know you can call me, I'll be there shortly
Don't care what your friends say, 'cause they don't know me
I can be your best friend, and you be my homie
I ain't gon' flex, I'm not gon' front
You know if I ball, then we all gon' stunt
Send her my way, she ain't gotta hold up
Whenever you call baby I roll up, I roll up, I roll up
Whenever you call baby I roll up, I roll up, I roll up
Whenever you call baby I roll up

No matter where I am
No matter where you are
I'll be there when it's over baby
'Cause I was there from the start
No matter if I'm near
Don't matter if your far
All you do is pick the phone up lady
And I'll be there when you call

Whenever you need me
Whenever want me,
You know you can call me, I'll be there shortly
Don't care what your friends say, 'cause they don't know me
I can be your best friend, and you be my homie

You know if I ball, then we all gon' stunt
Send her my way, she ain't gotta hold up
Whenever you call baby I roll up

Whenever you need me

You know you can call me, I'll be there shortly
Don't care what your friends say, 'cause they don't know me
I can be your best friend, and you be my homie
I ain't gon' flex, I'm not gon' front
You know if I ball, then we all gon' stunt
Send her my way, she ain't gotta hold up
Whenever you call baby I roll up, I roll up, I roll up
Whenever you call baby I roll up, I roll up, I roll up
Whenever you call baby I roll up
