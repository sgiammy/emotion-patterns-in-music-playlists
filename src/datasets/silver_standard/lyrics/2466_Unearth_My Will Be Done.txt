So many have lost their way
So many have fallen to their grip of faith
Controlled by their words of hate
Divided, we ravage our homelands

The abundance of of numbness can claim self-rule
Diseased transmission can claim us all

A system of panic enslaves
The binding obtainment brings darker days
A stand must be taken to save
No cries for us, the war is waged
It's done

I strive to find my way
My will be done
Work these hands until they bleed
My will be done
I'll listen for the call
My will be done
Now pray for your miracle
My will be done

No cries for us, the war is waged
My will be done

The abundance of numbness can claim self-rule
Diseased transmission can claim us all

So many have lost their way
So many have fallen to their grip of faith
Controlled by their words of hate
Divided, we perish

Now I strive to find my own way
My will be done
Work these hands until they bleed
My will be done
I'll listen for the call
My will be done
Now pray for your miracle
My will be done
