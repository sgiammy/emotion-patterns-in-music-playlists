Oh my God

Welcome to the jungle
We got fun and games
We got everything you want
Honey, we know the names

We are the people that can find
Whatever you may need
If you got the money, honey
We got your disease

In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your
Sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-knees, knees
Wha, I, I wanna watch you bleed

Welcome to the jungle
We take it day by day
If you want it, you're gonna bleed
But it's the price you pay

And you're a very sexy girl
Who's very hard to please
You can taste the bright lights
But you won't get them for free

In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my, my serpentine
Wha, I, I wanna hear you scream

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

Welcome to the jungle
It gets worse here every day
You learn to live like an animal
In the jungle where we play

If you got a hunger for what you see
You'll take it eventually
You can have anything you want
But you better not take it from me

In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your
Sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-knees, knees
Wha, I'm gonna watch you bleed

And when you're high you never
Ever want to come down
So down, so down, so down
Yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, ow

You know where you are?
You're in the jungle, baby
You're gonna die

In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your
Sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-knees, knees

In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Feel my, oh my, my, my serpentine

In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your
Sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-knees, knees

Down in the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your
It's gonna bring you down, huh
