Wanna see you whip it
Sho could treat you right
Give me just a minute
Of your time tonight
We both are here to have good fun
So let it whip

We'll get into grooving
Love your body language
Baby, let me know
You've got me sort of anxious
We both are here to have good fun
So let it whip

So let it whip (let's whip it, baby)
Child (let's whip it right)
Get a grip (let's whip it, baby, whip it all night)
Now don't you trip (no, no)
Child
Come on, let it whip (oh)

Now that you can see
How you groove with me
What else can I do
To get closer to you
We both are here to have good fun
So let it whip

We have the natural feeling
Obviously revealing
Let me be your paper man
I'd love to be your joker man
We both are here to have good fun
So let it whip

So let it whip (let's whip it, baby)
Child (let's whip it right)
Get a grip (let's whip it, baby, whip it all night)
Now don't you trip (no, no)
Child
Come on, let it whip (c'mon whip, c'mon whip)

So let it whip (let's whip it, baby)
Child (let's whip it right)
Get a grip (let's whip it, baby, whip it all night)
Now don't you trip (no, no)
Child
Come on, let it whip (c'mon whip, c'mon whip)

(There's no time to lose)
There is no time to lose, yeah
(You're the one I choose, you're so right)
You're the one I choose
I only want to be with you
You're the one for me
Can't you see that I
(I won't waste your time)
I won't waste your time
(I sense something divine in you)
Something divine in you
(Yes I do)
Ooh-hoo

So let it whip (let's whip it, baby)
Child (let's whip it right)
Get a grip (let's whip it, baby, whip it all night)
Now don't you trip (no, no)
Child
Come on, let it whip (c'mon whip, c'mon whip)

Let's whip it, baby
Let's whip it right
Let's whip it, baby
Whip it all night
C'mon whip, c'mon whip

(There's no time to lose)
There is no time to lose
(You're the one I choose, you're so right)
Hey, you're the one I choose
I only wanna be with you
You're the one for me
Can't you see that I
