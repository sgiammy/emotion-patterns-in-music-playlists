There's so many things that I could say
But I'm sure it would come out all wrong
You've got something that I can't explain
Still I try and try and let you know
That first summer we spent, one will never forget
Looking for any kind of reason to escape all the mess
That we thought is what made us
Ain't it funny now, we can see
We're who we're meant to be.

You still have all of my, x2
You still have all of my heart, oh!

There's to many times I have to say
I could have been better and stronger for you and me
You always make me feel okay
Those late summers we spend stay up talking all night
I ask, "You think we'd ever make it?"
You say, "I'm sure, if it's right."
And it's funny to think just how stupid I used to be
Hope you always believe.

You still have all of my, x2
You still have all of my heart.

You still have all of my, x2
You still have all of my heart

Let them talk and talk and talk
Let them say what they want
We will laugh at the thought; they don't know what we got
Every year that goes by, a year older we are
You'll still be beautiful then, bless your beautiful heart.

We'll talk and talk and talk
How crazy it seems
Someone can waste their whole life helplessly
Just patiently waiting for a love like you and me.

You still have all of my, x2
You still have all of my heart. x2

You still have all of my, x2
You still have of all my heart.

You still have all of my, x2
You still have all of my heart.
