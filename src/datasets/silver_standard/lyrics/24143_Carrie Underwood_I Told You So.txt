Suppose I called you up tonight and told you that I love you
And suppose I said I want to come back home
And suppose I cried and said I think I finally learned my lesson
And I'm tired of spending all my time alone

If I told you that I realized you're all I ever wanted
And it's killing me to be so far away
Would you tell me that you love me too and would we cry together
Or would you simply laugh at me and say

I told you so, oh, I told you so
I told you someday you'd come crawling back and asking me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
Now I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again

If I got down on my knees and told you I was yours forever
Would you get down on yours too and take my hand
Would we get that old time feeling, would we laugh and talk for hours
The way we did when our love first began

Would you tell me that you've missed me too and that you've been so lonely
And you've waited for the day that I returned
And we'd live in love forever and that I'm your one and only
Or would you say the tables finally turned

Would you say I told you so, oh, I told you so
I told you someday you'd come crawling back and asking me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
Now I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again
Now I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again
