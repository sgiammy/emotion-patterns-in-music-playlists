Kanye West and Nas:
No matter how many times I've tried to you
I can't lie to you, I can't lie to you
I never lied to you I can't
Can't lie y'all, he disrespected y'all
No matter how times I've tried to you
I can't lie to you, I can't lie to you, I can't

Kanye West:
Uh, just like a nigga, go figure
Some shit they said they might never figure
Mo' figures, more hating ass niggas
Mo' commas, more hating ass problems

No matter how much I've tried
No matter how much I've tried
Can't lie to you, I can't lie to you
No matter how many times I've
No matter how many rhymes I've
I got it all in my mind
I got it all in my mind
I can't lie to you
No matter how many times I've tried
I can't, I can't lie to you
I can't, I can't lie to you

French Montana:
Coming from the back block, posted like the backdrop
Rags to the riches, got rich bought the ragtop
Lot of homies died here, look at what the grind did
Put me in the same shoes, still do what Sean did
More bitches, more bitches, more riches
They don't want no broke niggas
But don't call them gold diggers
I don't know, I don't know, why I ain't get the picture?
Why Cosby slipped her?
Why I fucked 'em both when they said they sisters?
Why Eazy ain't have the Magic?
Why AR never want a trip?
And why God took Max and Chinx
And he ain't take me when I got hit?

No matter how much I've tried
No matter how much I've tried
Can't lie to you, I can't lie to you
No matter how many times I've
No matter how many rhymes I've
I got it all in my mind
I got it all in my mind
I can't lie to you
No matter how many times I've tried
I can't, I can't lie to you
I can't, I can't lie to you

Nas and Kanye West:
Beyond PÃ©rignon, the fame, the money
The Baccarat crystal that's hanging from the ceilings above me
Hearing people whisper, screaming I'm lucky but trust me
Nothing come free, shawty tried to keep my son from me
Or I could be delirious to take life serious
Remain single forever, can't wife nothing, period
I'm a G, I need privacy, media's never kind to me
Niggas beefing on small time things, we on a dying spree
He disrespected y'all
Just like a nigga, go figure
He talking reckless, yo
I can't accept it, yo
No matter how much I've tried
For the love of my people, I guess I'll let it go
I can't figure it out

No matter how much I've tried
No matter how much I've tried
Can't lie to you, I can't lie to you
No matter how many times I've
No matter how many rhymes I've
I got it all in my mind
I got it all in my mind
I can't lie to you
No matter how many times I've tried
I can't, I can't lie to you
I can't, I can't lie to you
