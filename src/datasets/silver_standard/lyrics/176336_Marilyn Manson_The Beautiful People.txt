And I don't want you and I don't need you
Don't bother to resist or I'll beat you
It's not your fault that you're always wrong
The weak ones are there to justify the strong

The beautiful people, the beautiful people
It's all relative to the size of your steeple
You can't see the forest for the trees
And you can't smell your own shit on your knees

There's no time to discriminate
Hate every motherfucker that's in your way

Hey, you, what do you see?
Something beautiful or something free?
Hey, you, are you trying to be mean?
You live with apes, man, it's hard to be clean

Ahh
Ahh

The worms will live in every host
It's hard to pick which one they hate the most
The horrible people, the horrible people
It's all anatomic as the size of your steeple

Capitalism has made it this way
Old-fashioned fascism will take it away

Hey, you, what do you see?
Something beautiful or something free?
Hey, you, are you trying to be mean?
You live with apes, man, it's hard to be clean

There's no time to discriminate
Hate every motherfucker that's in your way

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

The beautiful people, the beautiful people (ahh)
The beautiful people, the beautiful people (ahh)
The beautiful people, the beautiful people (ahh)
The beautiful people, the beautiful people (ahh)

Hey, you, what do you see?
Something beautiful or something free?
Hey, you, are you trying to be mean?
You live with apes, man, it's hard to be clean

Hey, you, what do you see?
Something beautiful or something free?
Hey, you, are you trying to be mean?
You live with apes, man, it's hard to be clean

The beautiful people, the beautiful people
The beautiful people, the beautiful people
The beautiful people, the beautiful people
The beautiful people, the beautiful people
