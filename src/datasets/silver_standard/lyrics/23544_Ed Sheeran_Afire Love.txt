Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that heaven is your resting place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could have been the medicine
And now you're lying in the bed again
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them.

And my father told me, "Son,
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face,
And you're not the only one.
Although my grandma used to say, he used to say...

Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while he wrote
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light, in life, in love.
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love, love, love oh.

Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your breath away
And now we're left here in the pain,
Black suit, black tie standing in the rain.
And now my family is one again,
Stapled together with the strangers and the friend.
Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen.
6 years old I remember when my father told me, "Son,
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face,
And you're not the only one.
Although my grandma used to say, he used to say...

Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while he wrote
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light, in life, in love.
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love, love, love oh.'
See the love the love the love the love
See the love the love the love the love
See the love the love the love the love

And my father and all of my family rise from the seats to sing Hallelujah

And my brother and all my family rise from the seats to sing Hallelujah

(And all my brothers and my sisters yeah)

And my brother and all of my family rise from the seats to sing Hallelujah

See the love the love the love the love
See the love the love the love the love
See the love the love the love the love
