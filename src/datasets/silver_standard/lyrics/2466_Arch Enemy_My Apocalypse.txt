Sudden implosion of silenced emotions
Buried beneath a scarred heart for too long
Delusions of hope fading away
Dying like leaves on frozen soil

My apocalypse is near
I can feel the end... coming here

Neglecting existence repulse and repent
An endless journey into the morbid
Whispering voices distorting all senses
Buried beneath a scarred heart for too long

My apocalypse is near
I can feel the end... coming here

The bitter taste of a dying dream
Shine the light on our shadows and illusions
