I am after you
A shadow on the hunt
Don't turn around
I am right behind you

I will get to you
And take you down
Tear your insides out
Crush your soul

I am out for blood
Out for your blood

I am harder than steel
Break your will
Waiting all my life
To kill

I will get to you
And take you down


Tear your insides out
Crush your soul

I am out for blood
Out for your blood

I can smell your flesh
I can taste your sweat
I can sens your fear
I am right here

I am out for blood
Out for your blood

Out for blood (x3)

Out for blood (x3)
