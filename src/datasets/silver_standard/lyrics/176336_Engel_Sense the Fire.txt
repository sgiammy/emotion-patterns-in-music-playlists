Never think that you and I
Would come to this together
Wherever we go, wherever we look
It's always at the same things

You're the backup for me
I could never believe
That misery is mutual

What did we do to deserve
Penetrations unheard
But I'm always looking forward

Oh, you and me fight together
Scream together
I think I feel the power
Sense the fire

The distance is cold
Our pledge has gone old
The darkness is all over

You scramble my words
And you shiver my spine
You left me wanting more, though

Oh, you and me fight together
Scream together
I think I feel the power
Sense the fire

Oh, you and me fight together
Scream together
I think I feel the power
Sense the fire
