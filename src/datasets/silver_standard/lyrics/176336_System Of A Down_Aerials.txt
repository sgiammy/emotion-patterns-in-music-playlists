Life is a waterfall
We're one in the river and one again after the fall
Swimming through the void we hear the word
We lose ourselves but we find it all

'Cause we are the ones that wanna play
Always want to go but you never wanna stay
We are the ones that wanna choose
Always want to play but you never wanna lose

Aerials in the sky
When you lose small mind, you free your life

Life is a waterfall
We drink from the river then we turn around and put up our walls
Swimming through the void, we hear the word
We lose ourselves but we find it all

'Cause we are the ones that wanna play
Always want to go but you never wanna stay
We are the ones that wanna choose
Always want to play but you never wanna lose, oh

Aerials in the sky
When you lose small mind, you free your life
Aerials, so up high
When you free your eyes, eternal prize

Aerials in the sky
When you lose small mind, you free your life
Aerials, so up high
When you free your eyes, eternal prize

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
