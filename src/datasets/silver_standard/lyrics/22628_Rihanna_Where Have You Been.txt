I've been everywhere, man
Looking for someone
Someone who can please me
Love me all night long

I've been everywhere, man
Looking for you, babe
Looking for you, babe
Searching for you, babe

Where have you been?
'Cause I never see you out
Are you hiding from me, yeah,
Somewhere in the crowd?

Ohh..

Where have you been,
All my life, all my life?

Where have you been all my life
Where have you been all my life
Where have you been all my life
Where have you been all my life?

I've been everywhere, man
Looking for someone
Someone who can please me
Love me all night long

I've been everywhere, man
Looking for you, babe
Looking for you, babe
Searching for you, baby

Where have you been?
'Cause I never see you out
Are you hiding from me, yeah,
Somewhere in the crowd?

Ohh...

Where have you been,
All my life, all my life?


Where have you been all my life
Where have you been all my life
Where have you been all my life
Where have you been all my life

You can help me all you want,
Anyway, anyday
Just show me where you are tonight,
Oh, yeah, oh

Looking for someone
Someone who can please me
