I'm the man, I'm the king, I'm the one that's pure inside
Everyday, every way, I smell of suicide
Bitter sins, how they grow within, so tell me it ain't right
I am all sins and you're my reason for life

I will stone you, stone you, wrap my arms around you
I will stone you, stone you, my little halo
I will stone you, stone you, wrap my arms around you
I will stone you, stone you, my little halo

I'm the man, I'm the king, I'm the one that's broken from givin'
Everyday, every way, I swear just one last try
Killin' me with the death to be, something that's so right
I am all sins, my hands are scarred with time

I will stone you, stone you, wrap my arms around you
I will stone you, stone you, my little halo
I will stone you, stone you, wrap my arms around you
I will stone you, stone you, my little halo

Stop, look at me!

Look through my eyes

I'm the man with the rock in his hand
Got the rock in my hand, gonna stone you, stone you
I'm the man with the rock in his hand
Got the rock in my hand, gonna stone you, stone you
I'm the man with the rock in his hand
Got the rock in my hand, gonna stone you, stone you
I'm the man with the rock in his hand
Got the rock in my hand, gonna stone you

Make a change, gotta rearrange, idle minds crushin' time
I am all sins and you're my reason for life

I will stone you, stone you, wrap my arms around you
I will stone you, stone you, my little halo
I will stone you, stone you, wrap my arms around you
I will stone you, stone you, my little halo

I will stone you, stone you, put my goddamn arms around you
I will stone you, stone you, my little halo
I will stone you, stone you, put my arms around you
I will stone you, stone you, my little halo
