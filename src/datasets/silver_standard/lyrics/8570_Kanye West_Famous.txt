Man I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
Swizz told me let the beat rock

For all my Southside niggas that know me best
I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex
Why? I made that bitch famous
God damn
I made that bitch famous
For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West
If you see 'em in the streets give 'em Kanye's bests
Why? They mad they ain't famous
God damn
They mad they're still nameless
(Talk that talk man)
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
But we still hood famous
God damn
Yeah we still hood famous

I just wanted you to know
I loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
Wake up, Mr West
I just wanted you to know

I be Puerto Rican day parade floatin'
That Benz Marina Del Rey coastin'
She be Puerto Rican day parade wavin'
Last month I helped her with the car payment
Young and we alive, whoo!
We never gonna die, whoo!
I just copped a jet to fly over personal debt
Put one up in the sky
The sun is in my eyes, whoo!
Woke up and felt the vibe, whoo!
No matter how hard they try, whoo!
We never gonna die

I just wanted you to know

Bam bam, bam bam
Bam bam dilla, bam bam
'Ey what a bam bam
How you feeling right now, let me see your lighters in the air
Bam bam dilla, bam bam

'Ey what a bam bam
Bam bam dilla, bam bam
How you feelin', how you feelin', how you feelin' in this mother fucker, god damn
Bam bam
One thing you can't do it stop us now
Bam bam, bam bam
Bam bam dilla, bam bam
You can't stop the thing now
'Ey what a bam bam
Man it's way too late, it's way too late, it's way too late you can't
Bam bam dilla, bam bam
Bam bam, bam bam
Bam bam, bam bam
To the left, to the right
Bam bam dilla, bam bam
I wanna see everyone's hands in the air like this
'Ey what a bam bam
Bam bam, bam bam
Bam bam dilla, bam bam

I just wanted you to know
I loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
