I've been defeated and brought down
Oh, dropped to my knees when hope ran out
Oh, the time has come to change my ways

On this day, I see clearly
Everything has come to life
A bitter place and a broken dream
And we'll leave it all, leave it all behind

I'll never long for what might have been
No, regret won't waste my life again
Oh, I won't look back, I'll fight to remain

On this day, I see clearly
Everything has come to life
A bitter place and a broken dream
And we'll leave it all behind

On this day, it's so real to me
Everything has come to life
Another chance to chase a dream
Another chance to feel, chance to feel alive

Fear will kill me, all I could be
Lift these sorrows, let me breathe
Could you set me free?
Could you set me free?

On this day, I see clearly
Everything has come to life
A bitter place and a broken dream
And we'll leave it all behind

On this day, it's so real to me
Everything has come to life
Another chance to chase a dream
Another chance to feel, chance to feel alive
