We the motherfuckin' best nigga
Ace Hood
Super, Future

I come looking for you with Haitians
I stay smoking on good Jamaican
I fuck bitches from different races
You get money they started hating (Turn up)
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti
I woke up in a new Bugatti

Niggas be hatin' I'm rich as a bitch, 100K I spent that on my wrist
200 dollars, I spent that on your bitch, do me a model, put that on my list
Oh, there he go in that foreign again, killin' the scene bring the coroner in
Murder she wrote, swallow or choke, hit her and go home, I won't call her again
Woke up early morning, crib as big as a college
Smoke me a pound of the loudest, whippin' some shit with no mileage
Diamonds cost me a fortune, them horses all in them Porsches
You pussies can't hardly afford it, 4,200 my mortgage
Ballin' on niggas like Kobe, fuck all you haters you bore me
Only the real get a piece of the plate, reppin' my city I'm runnin' my state
Give me a pistol then run with the K's, niggas want beef then I visit ya place (Bang!)

Yeah, and I'm at it again, there go that flow bringin' tragedy in
Copped me a chain your salary spent, niggas is sweet bring them cavities in
Countin' money, hourly trend, rolling them skinny like Olsen twins
Niggas is squares, coppin' a Benz, neck full of Gold Olympian shit
Neimans, I'm blowing the check on they gear, fall on some pussy then hop on the Lear
Strapped with them choppers back of the rear, sak pase' them killers is here
Woke up early this morning, mind is tellin' me money, paper, mula, pockets is fat as a tumor
Millionaire nigga no rumor, livin' my life off of tuna
Wanted with me I deliver the beef, real niggas only enjoyin' the feast
Pull up a seat, bon app√©tit, no Louboutins put that red on your sneaks (Bang!)

Photographs of dope boys, is all they taking
Finger prints on the Rolls Royce, is why they hatin'
Push a button on these broke boys, that's detonation
Walk a road to riches bare feet
I watch mama struggle now she livin' carefree
That's why I hustle for half a key that's 12 G's
I'm tryin' to bubble every summer a new LP
You gotta love me I got shooters out the D-League
Signin' bonus hit that man that's from thirty feet
Left in a puddle, finger prints is on hundred mill and what it is?
Ricky Rozay and Ace Hood, we hella Trill
Yeah

I come looking for you with Haitians (What you know about this?)
