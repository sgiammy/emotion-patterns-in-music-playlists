Let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor

Beaten, why for?  
(Why for?)
Can't take much more

(Here we go, here we go, here we go, now)
(One) 
Nothin' wrong with me
(Two)
Nothin' wrong with me
(Three) 
Nothin' wrong with me
(Four) 
Nothin' wrong with me
(One) 
Somethin's got to give
(Two) 
Somethin's got to give
(Three) 
Somethin's got to give, now

Let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor
Move

Push me again  
(Again)
This is the end

(Here we go, here we go, here we go, now)
(One) 
Nothin' wrong with me
(Two)
Nothin' wrong with me
(Three) 
Nothin' wrong with me
(Four) 
Nothin' wrong with me
(One) 
Somethin's got to give
(Two) 
Somethin's got to give
(Three) 
Somethin's got to give, now

Let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor

Skin against skin blood and bone
You're all by yourself but you're not alone
You wanted in, and now you're here
Driven by hate, consumed by fear

Let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor

(One) 
Nothin' wrong with me
(Two)
Nothin' wrong with me
(Three) 
Nothin' wrong with me
(Four) 
Nothin' wrong with me
(One) 
Somethin's got to give
(Two) 
Somethin's got to give
(Three) 
Somethin's got to give, now

Let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor
Let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor

Hey, go, hey, go, hey, go, hey, go
