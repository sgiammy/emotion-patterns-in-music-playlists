Waiting
On a Sunday afternoon
For what I read between the lines
Your lies

Feelin'
Like a hand in rusted shame
So do you laugh or does it cry
Reply

Leavin' on a southern train
Only yesterday you lied
Promises of what I seemed to be
Only watched the time go by
All of these things you said to me

Breathing
Is the hardest thing to do
With all I've said and all that's dead for you
You lied
Goodbye

Leavin' on a southern train
Only yesterday you lied
Promises of what I seemed to be
Only watched the time go by
All of these things I said to you
