This place is a bloodbath
And won't be taken alive
We stand alone
Under fictitious skies

You were always my enemy and carefully crafted my demise *2x*
Our hearts beat strong under fictitious skies
You were always my enemy, suck the life out of me
Your words are deadly weapons
Killing me, destroying me
Your words are deadly weapons
Scatter my brains across the wall

You were my compass
Leading me to nowhere fast
Promises were lonely roads
I followed you down like a map

You were always my enemy and carefully crafted my demise *2x*
Our hearts beat strong under fictitious skies
You were always my enemy, suck the life out of me
Your words are deadly weapons
Killing me, destroying me
Your words are deadly weapons
Scatter my brains across the wall

Fuck you
Secrets don't make friends *3x*
Secrets don't make...

Your words are deadly weapons
Killing me, destroying me

*2x*
Your words are deadly weapons
Killing me, destroying me
Your words are deadly weapons
Scatter my brains across the wall

Secrets don't make friends
