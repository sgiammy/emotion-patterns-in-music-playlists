Died last night in my dreams 
Walking the streets 
Of some old ghost town 
I tried to believe 
In God and James Dean 
But Hollywood sold out 

Saw all of the saints 
Lock up the gates 
I could not enter 
Walked into the flames 
Called out your name 
But there was no answer 

And now I know my heart is a ghost town 
My heart is a ghost town 
My heart is a ghost town 
My heart is a ghost town 

Died last night in my dreams 
All the machines 
Had been disconnected 
Time was thrown at the wind 
And all of my friends 
Had been disaffected 

Now, I'm searching for trust 
In a city of rust 
A city of vampires 
Tonight, Elvis is dead 
And everyone's spread 
And love is a satire 

And now I know my heart is a ghost town 
My heart is a ghost town 
My heart is a ghost town 
My heart is a ghost town 

There's no one left in the world 
I'm gunslingin' 
Don't give a damn if I go 
Down, down, down 
I got a voice in my head that keeps singing 
Oh, my heart is a ghost town 

My heart is a ghost town 
Oh, my heart is a ghost town 
(Said, my heart) 
My heart is a ghost town 
My heart is a ghost town
