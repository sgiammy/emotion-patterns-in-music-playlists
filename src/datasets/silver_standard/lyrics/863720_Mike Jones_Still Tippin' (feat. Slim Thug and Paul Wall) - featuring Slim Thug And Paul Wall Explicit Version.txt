~Slim Thug~
Now look who creepin' look who crawlin still ballin' in da mix
Is that sick six long weeks that stick on yo cheek
Pullin tricks lookin' slick at our time when I'm flippin
Boy sippin, card lippin grad wood grain grippin
Still tippin on volvos, wrapped in volvos pimpin' hoes
Blowin' on that endo gamecube nintendo
Five percent tint so you can't see up in my window
These ni**as don't understand me 'cause I'm boss hog candy
Top down the mexus with a big glock 9 handy
Peaced up creeped up stayin dress to impress big bauz buckle under my under my michoines oh
Gucci shades up on my brades when I escalade
When I'm ridin' spreewheel slidin like an escapade
I got it made, da big boss of da nouth I ain't shit change I still represent with-cha hoes
Still tippin on fo-fos rapped in fo-fos (2x)
Tippin on fo-fos rapped in fo-fos tippin on fo-fos
Rapped in fo-fos tippin fo-fos and now I'm back in fo-fos
~Mike Jones~
4,4s I'm tippin, wood grain I'm grippin, catch me lane-switchin with tha paint drippin
Turn your neck and yo dame missin'
Me and Slim we ain't trippin'
I'm finger flippin and syrup sippin like Do Or Die I'm po pimpin'
Car stoppin' rims keep spinnin
I'm flippin drops with invisible tops
Hoes bubble when my top steps out dem shakin their block
With four 18's candy green leather seats
My gasoline always surpreme
It tastes good to be a king
First round yo peeps callin who is mike jones comin'
I'm mike jones... who mike jones
The one and only you can't clone me
Got alot of haters and alot homies
Some friends and some fony
Back then hoes didn't want me now I'm hot hoes all on me (3x)
I said back then hoes didn't want me now I'm hot hoes all on me
Still tippin on volvos rapped in volvos (2x)
Tippin on volvos rapped in volvos tippin on volvos
Rapped in volvos tippin volvos and now I'm back in volvos

~Paul Wall~
What they do this is Paul Wall I'm the people's champ
My chain light up like a lamp 'cause now I'm back with the camp
I'm probably similar to an ant 'cause I'm low to da earth
People's feelings get hurt when they figure out what I'm worth
I got 84's pokin out at tha club I'm showing out
Ima playa ain't no doubt hoes wanna know what ima bout
Biggest diamonds off in my mouth prisious cuts on in my chain
Wood grain all in my range drippin stains when I switch lanes
Switch the name is still the same
Swisha House or Swisha blast mike jones he runnin' the game and magnificent about his cash
Michael Watts he made me hott all worth to me to the top
He wrote a check and bought a truck
I got the internet going nuts but T Phere has got my back so now I'm holding my nuts
Its Paul Wall baby what you know 'bout me I'm on the five now south baby holla at me
Still tippin on volvos rapped in volvos (2x)
Tippin on volvos rapped in volvos tippin on volvos
Rapped in volvos tippin volvos and now I'm back in volvos
