We must bear our souls, souls, souls
Let the fate we get take hold, hold, hold
Baby when you come real close, close, close
It's all right 'cause I am whole

'Cause I have been running too long
I wanna love now
I wanna love now
I wanna feel
Don't weight up this heart that you hold
I wanna love now
I wanna love now
I wanna feel

We can tiptoe round our dreams, dreams, dreams
Just to crash through reality, yeah
I won't spend it eternity
Hoping this time I'll be free, free

'Cause I have been running too long
I wanna love now
I wanna love now
I wanna feel
Don't weight up this heart that you hold
I wanna love now
I wanna love now
I wanna feel

'Cause I have been running too long
I wanna love now
I wanna love now
I wanna feel
Don't weight up this heart that you hold
I wanna love now
I wanna love now
I wanna feel
