Daydreamer, sitting on the seat
Soaking up the sun, he is a real lover
Making up the past
And feeling up his girl like he's never felt a figure before
A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks
He's the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch
And he could change the world with his hands behind his back

You can find him sitting on your doorstep
Waiting for the surprise
It will feel like he's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life

Daydreamer, with eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be
But he stays all the same, waits for you, then sees you through
There's no way I could describe him
What I'll say is, just what I'm hoping for

But I will find him sitting on my doorstep
Waiting for the surprise
He will feel like he's been there for hours
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
