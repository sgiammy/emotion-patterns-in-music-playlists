'Cause I was still unsure but it's something I'm used to
And I can tell by your face, no one's ever been rude to you
But I can tell you things that I can't say to anyone
And you came home today but you didn't stay very long

Now it's like the world owes you
Walking around like everybody should know you
I wanna be like we used to
But now you're worried 'cause that means we'd lose you

And I had no idea what that feeling could do to you
And I could tell you changed by the people around you
I used to take the long way just so I could walk past your door
I used to wait outside but I guess I won't anymore

There's so much I wanna tell you, so much I wanna tell you
