(Angel, angel, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa)
(Angel, angel, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa)

You are my special angel
Sent from up above
The Lord smiled down on me
And sent an angel to love (to love)

You are my special angel
Right from paradise
I know you're an angel
Heaven is in your eyes

The smile from your lips brings the summer sunshine
Tears from your eyes bring the rain
I feel your touch, your warm embrace
And I'm in heaven again

You are my special angel
Through eternity
I'll have my special angel
Here to watch over me

(A smile from your lips brings the summer sunshine)
(The tears from your eyes bring the rain)
I feel your touch, your warm embrace
And I'm in heaven again

You are my special angel
Through eternity
I'll have my special angel
Here to watch over me (watch over me)

Here to watch over me
(Angel, angel, whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh oh, oh)
