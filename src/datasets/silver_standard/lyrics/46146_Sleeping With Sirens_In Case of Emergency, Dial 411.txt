I can save you (I can save you)
If you ask me, just ask me to
There's hope for you tonight

I can save you (I can save you)
If you ask me, just ask me to
I can save your life

I saw you move from across the room
I knew who you were
You act like you are afraid of who you are
I'm afraid for you

Try, trust and believe in me
I can show you that there's so much more
There's still hope for you
Let me show you I can save you

I can save you (I cam save you)
If you ask me, just ask me to
There's hope for you tonight

I can save you (I can save you)
If you ask me, just ask me to
I can save your life

One day you'll open your eyes and take a look inside
I just saved your life
Just take a look inside, I hope you know what it's like
For you to be alright

I am for you

Don't give up, just believe, I will be right there
When your hopes and your dreams are on the line, on the line
Don't give up, just believe, I'll be right by your side
When your hopes and your dreams are on the line, on the line

I can save you (I can save you)
If you ask me, just ask me to
There's hope for you tonight

I can save you (I can save you)
If you ask me, just ask me to
I can save your life
