Yo
Okay

All my niggas with me
All my niggas with it
All my niggas ballin'
All my niggas athletic
All my niggas A1
All got street cred
All my niggas balling
All my niggas athletic

Pulled up in the phantom
Pulled off with a dancer
Got a pocket full of money
Kinda hard to keep my pants up
Nigga tryna run them bands up
Fuck a bitch with my hands up
Lil Que fucked the Xans up
Kinda hard to understand her
Duffle bags in the Escalade
Call the bitch there a bread truck
Got the bitch going retarded
Call Uber for a spare truck
All these niggas never scared us
All these niggas never ran up
Bitch tryna put the head on me
Niggas tryna put the feds on me

Niggas tryna take meds on me
Everything for the players only
Niggas sunny like Arizona
Gunshots just for saying something
Spraying shit like Aerosol
You a foul and that's a fair ball
Nigga can't reach the goal
Keep shooting that there air ball

Watch out lil' bitch
Watch out lil' bitch
Watch out lil' bitch
Watch out lil' bitch
You getting mad
I'm getting rich
You getting mad
And I'm getting rich

Watch out lil' bitch
Watch out lil' bitch
Watch out lil' bitch
Watch out lil' bitch
You getting mad

You getting mad
Bitch I'm getting rich

Watch out lil' hoe
My partners still smoke on parole
They say that I'm crazy
I used to talk to a stove
I tell it to lock
Shit I tell it a lot
Go to the dealership
Fishtail off the lot

You know I'm coming straight up the block
You know I'm coming straight out the top
Shawty said she want five million
'Cause I told her to leave and call her a thot
Shit, you can like it or not
I'm coming straight out the pot
Still got some eq in my stock
Nigga I ain't gotta lie
Nigga I ain't gotta try
You waving that thing in the sky
We waving that thing at your body
We waving that thing at your eye
Look at the watch on my wrist
Yeah I don't mind watching my wrist
Told that lil' bitch I'll pass
Nigga watch the assist

I run the track like the marathon
You niggas softer than silicone
You know what it's like when the feeling gone
I know what it's like when the ceiling gone
I had a sit down with Farrakhan
Turn the White House to the Terror Dome
I used to serve at the Chevron
I used to serve with my necklace on, bitch

Watch out lil' bitch
Watch out lil' bitch
Watch out lil' bitch
Watch out lil' bitch
You getting mad
I'm getting rich
You getting mad
And I'm getting rich

Watch out lil' bitch
Watch out lil' bitch
Watch out lil' bitch
Hey, watch out lil' bitch
You getting mad
I'm getting rich
You getting mad
Bitch I'm getting rich
