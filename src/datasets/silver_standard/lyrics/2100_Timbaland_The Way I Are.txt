State of emergency...
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Remember the time, baby. Yeah! Yeah!

Timbaland
I ain't got no money
I ain't got no car to take you on a date
I can't even buy you flowers
But together we could be the perfect soulmates
Talk to me, girl

Keri Hilson
Oh, baby, it's all right, now you ain't gotta flaunt for me
If we go dutch, you can still touch my love, it's free
We can work without the perks, just you and me
Thug it out till we get it right

Baby, if you strip, you could get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are

Timbaland
I'm about to strip and I'm well equipped
Can you handle me the way I are

Keri Hilson
I don't need the cheese or the car keys
Boy, I like you just the way you are

Timbaland
Let me see ya strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like, I like, I like

I ain't got no Visa
I ain't got no Red American Express
We can't go nowhere exotic
It don't matter 'cause I'm the one that loves you best
Talk to me, girl

Keri Hilson
Oh, baby, it's all right, now you ain't gotta flaunt for me
If we go dutch, you can still touch my love, it's free

D.O.E.
Baby girl, I don't got a huge ol' house, I rent a room in a house
Listen baby girl, I ain't got a motorboat, but I could float your boat
So listen baby girl, once you get a dose of D.O.E., you gon' want some mo'
So listen baby girl, when I make it, I want you there, want you there, yeah

Sebastian
Yeah my money and me loof like feel me them,
And it's really not quite Louis Allason,
Your body ain't Pamela Anderson,
It's a struggle just to get you in the caravan,
But listen baby girl,
Before I let you lose a pound I'll buy a bigger car,
So listen baby girl,
I love you just the way you are, the way you are

Keri Hilson
