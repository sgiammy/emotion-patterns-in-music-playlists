Oh baby, oh man
You're making my crazy, really driving me mad
That's all right with me, it's really no fuss
As long as you're next to me just the two of us

You're my, my, my, my kind of woman
My, oh my, what a girl
You're my, my, my, my kind of woman
And I'm down on my hands and knees
Begging you please, baby, show me your world

Oh brother, sweetheart
I'm feeling so tired really falling apart
And it just don't make sense to me, I really don't know
Why you stick right next to me or wherever I go

You're my, my, my, my kind of woman
My, oh my, what a girl
You're my, my, my, my kind of woman
And I'm down on my hands and knees
Begging you please, baby, show me your world
