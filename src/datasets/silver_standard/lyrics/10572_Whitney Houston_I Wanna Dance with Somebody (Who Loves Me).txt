Clock strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done all right up to now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls, loneliness calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down

I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Somebody ooh, somebody ooh
Somebody who loves me yeah
Somebody ooh, somebody ooh
To hold me in his arms oh

I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Don't ya wanna dance with me baby
Don't ya wanna dance with me boy
Hey don't ya wanna dance with me baby
With somebody who loves me

Don't ya wanna dance, say you wanna dance, don't ya wanna dance
Don't ya wanna dance, say you wanna dance, don't ya wanna dance
Don't ya wanna dance, say you wanna dance
With somebody who loves me
Dance
