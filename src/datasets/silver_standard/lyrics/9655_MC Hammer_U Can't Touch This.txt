You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this (oh-oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh)
You can't touch this (oh-oh oh oh, oh-oh-oh)

My, my, my, my (you can't touch this)
Music hits me so hard
Makes me say oh my Lord
Thank you for blessing me
With a mind to rhyme and two hype feet
It feels good when you know you're down
A super dope homeboy from the Oaktown
And I'm known as such
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch

I told you, homeboy (you can't touch this)
Yeah, that's how we livin' and ya know (you can't touch this)
Look in my eyes, man (you can't touch this)
Yo, let me bust the funky lyrics (you can't touch this)

Fresh new kicks and pants
You got it like that, now you know wanna dance
So move out of your seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat
While it's rolling, hold on
Pump a little bit and let them know it's going on
Like that, like that
Cold on a mission so fall on back
Let 'em know that you're too much
And this is a beat, uh, they can't touch

Yo, I told you (you can't touch this)
Why you standing there, man (you can't touch this)
Yo, sound the bell school's in, sucker (you can't touch this)

Give me a song or rhythm
Making 'em sweat, that's what I'm giving 'em
Now they know
You talk about the Hammer, you're talking about a show
That's hyped and tight
Singers are sweatin', so pass them a wipe
Or a tape to learn
What it's gonna take in the '90's to burn
The charts, legit
Either work hard or you might as well quit

That's word because you know (you can't touch this)
(You can't touch this)
Break it down

(Oh-oh-oh oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh oh)
Stop, Hammer time

Go with the flow, it is said
If you can't groove to this, then you probably are dead
So wave your hands in the air
Bust a few moves, run your fingers through your hair
This is it for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Move, slide your rump
Just for a minute, let's all do the bump
(Bump, bump, bump)

Yeah (you can't touch this)
Look, man (you can't touch this)
You'll better get hype boy cause you know you can't (you can't touch this)
Ring the bell, school's back in
Break it down

(Oh-oh-oh oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh oh)
Stop, Hammer time

(You can't touch this)
(You can't touch this)
(You can't touch this)
Break it down

(Oh-oh-oh oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh oh)
Stop, Hammer time

Every time you see me, the Hammer's just so hype
I'm dope on the floor, and I'm magic on the mic
Now why would I ever stop doing this
With others making records that just don't hit
I toured around the world from London to the Bay
It's “Hammer, go Hammer, MC Hammer, yo Hammer”
And the rest can go and play

Can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
Yeah, you can't touch this
I told you, can't touch this
Too hype, can't touch this
Yo, we outta here, can't touch this
(Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh)
