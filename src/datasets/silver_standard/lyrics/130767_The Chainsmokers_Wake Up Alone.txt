Now I got cars, now I got clothes, now I got money
Now I got crowds screamin' my name sayin' they love me
You got real close, say I'm not alone, you understand me
But late at night, when I close my eyes, the quiet scares me

Will you still care in the morning?
When the magic's gone, gone, oh?
And will you be there in the morning?
Do you stay when it all goes?
Or will I wake up alone?

Wake up alone
Wake up alone

I don't need cars, I don't need clothes, forget that money
'Cause if I go home all on my own, it ain't worth nothing

Will you still care in the morning?
When the magic's gone, gone, oh?
And will you be there in the morning?
Do you stay when it all goes?
Or will I wake up alone?

Wake up alone
Wake up alone
Wake up alone
Wake up alone

Will you still care in the morning?
When the magic's gone, gone, oh?
And will you be there in the morning?
Do you stay when it all goes?
Or will I wake up alone?

Wake up alone
Wake up alone
Wake up alone
Or will I wake up alone?
