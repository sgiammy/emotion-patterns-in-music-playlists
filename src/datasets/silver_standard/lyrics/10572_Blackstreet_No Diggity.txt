Yeah, you know what
I like the playettes
No diggity, no doubt, uh
Play on playette, play on playette
Yo Dre, drop the verse

It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me, collab creations
Bump like acne, no doubt
I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch
A dog couldn't catch me ass out
Tell me who could stop with Dre makin' moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving them eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavor
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers

Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em up open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much grounds, got game by the pound

Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind (well)
I think about the girl all the time (well, well)

East side to the west side
Push your phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash, stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas

By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down so I can win

I like the way you work it (no diggity)
I got to bag it up (bag it up)
I like the way you work it (no diggity, no diggity)
I got to bag it up (bag it up, girl)
I like the way you work it (no diggity)
I got to bag it up (bag it up)
I like the way you work it (no diggity, no diggity)
I got to bag it up (get up)

She's got class and style
Street knowledge by the pound
Baby never act wild
Very low key on the profile

Catchin' feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Curve's the words, spin's the verbs
Lovers it curves, so freak what you heard (oh)

Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You got to pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way

I like the way you work it
Trump tight all day every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride

I like the way you work it (no diggity)
I got to bag it up (bag it up)
I like the way you work it (no diggity, no diggity)
I got to bag it up (ho, ho, yeah)
I like the way you work it (no diggity)
I got to bag it up (bag it up, babe)
I like the way you work it (no diggity, no diggity)
I got to bag it up (get up)

Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (hey yo, that girl looks good)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (play on, play on, playette)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (you're my kind of girl)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (hey, yeah, yo)

Cause that's my peeps and we row G
Flyin' first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me, not a motherfuckin' thing
Cartier wooded frames sported by my shorty
As for me, icy gleaming pinky diamond ring
We be's the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake-ass broads
I shows and proves, no doubt, I be taking you, so
Please excuse if I come across rude, that's just me
And that's how a playette's got to be
Stay kickin' game with a capital G
Ask the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is bond, faking moves never been my thing
So, Teddy, pass the word to your nigga Chauncey
I be sending a car, let's say around 3:30
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity

(No diggity, no doubt, baby)
I like the way you work it (no diggity)
I got to bag it up (girl, you got it goin' on)
I like the way you work it (no diggity, play on, play on)
I got to bag it up (play on, playette, play on)
I like the way you work it (no diggity)
I got to bag it up (hey, yeah, yeah)
I like the way you work it (no diggity, no diggity)
I got to bag it up (hey yeah, baby)

Yeah
Come on
Jackie in full effect
Lisa in full effect
Nikki in full effect
Tameka in full effect
Elise in full effect
Ain't nuthin' going on but the record

Yeah
Play on, playette (play on, playette)
Play on (play on)
Play on (play on)
Cause I like it (right)
No diggity
No doubt
Yeah
Blackstreet Productions
We out, we out, right
We out, we out
