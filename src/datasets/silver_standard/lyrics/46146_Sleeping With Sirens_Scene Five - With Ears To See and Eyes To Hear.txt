True friends lie underneath
Their witty words I don't believe
I can't believe a damn thing they say anymore, anymore.
Lie, liar you'll pay for your sins
Lie, liar you'll pay for your sins

So tell me
How does it feel, how does it feel to be like you?
I think your mouth should be quiet
'Cause never tells the truth
Now so tell me
So tell me why
Why does it have to be this way? Why can't things ever change?

I'm falling over, and over again, ...from/see
From the place I was, to the place I am
To the place I want to be
For the mountains I've been climbing over and under and over.

So tell me
How does it feel, how does it feel to be like you?
I think your mouth should be quiet
It never tells the truth
So tell me
So tell me why
Why does it have to be this way? Why can't things ever change?

So "come down now, come down from your tower,
Come down now from your tower,
Come down, come down from your tower,
Come down, come down, come down from your tower"
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

"Come down, come down from your tower"
Oh-oh-oh.
Oh-oh-oh
"Come down, come down from your tower"
Oh-oh-oh.
Oh-oh-oh
"Come down, come down from your tower"
Oh-oh-oh.
Oh-oh-oh
"Come down, come down from your tower".
