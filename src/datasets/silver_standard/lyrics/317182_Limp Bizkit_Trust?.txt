Back stabbers
(Back stabbers)
Two-faced
(Two faced)
Lowlifes
(Lowlifes)
It's time to step up
To the plate

A-one, two
A-one, two
A-one, two
What the fuck you gonna do

You know I see
Right through you
You act like you
Don't know me

You lie, you cheat
You steal, you lose
Wouldn't wanna be
In your shoes

Always lookin'
Over your shoulder
For the ones you stick
You sick little prick

It looks like your times
Runnin' out
I'm creapin' up your back
So whatcha you all about

I'm too fuckin' good
And fuckin' proud
I'm gonna show you how
Bad it hurts
To be a clown

You're the kind of guy
With two faces
Just another life
That's wasted

Here's a little fact
You do me like that.
End up in the back
Of my trunk in a sack

You'd better keep
Your hands off
What's mine
And anybody else's

When you're selfish
Your wealth is
All you crave from
The cradle to the grave

I'm too fuckin' good
And fuckin' proud
I'm gonna show you how
Bad it hurts
To be a clown

I'm too fuckin' good
And fuckin' proud
I'm gonna show you how
Bad it hurts
To be a clown

I got a little bitty question
Just what the fuck
Are you thinkin'
You think you're all
That and then some
Well you're not

I think you're dum
Ditty dum

I take it back
Those thoughts
Are kinda whack
Don't really need
That kind of karma on the track

Maybe Freddy Krueger
Will step into your dream
And burn you like a demon
And leave your ass screamin'

To be exact I wanted to react
Mission of attack
Your head was
Gettin' cracked

But you're a human bein'
That's lucky to be breathin'
And that's that
That's, that

I don't trust nodboy
And nobody trust me
Never gonna trust anybody
And that's the way it's gonna be

I don't trust nodboy
And nobody trust me
Never gonna trust anybody
And that's the way it's gonna be

I don't trust nodboy
And nobody trust me
Never gonna trust anybody
And that's the way it's gonna be

I don't trust nodboy
And nobody trust me
Never gonna trust anybody
And that's the way it's gonna be

I'm too fuckin' good
And fuckin' proud
I'm gonna show you how
Bad it hurts
To be a clown

I'm too fuckin' good
And fuckin' proud
I'm gonna show you how
Bad it hurts
To be a clown
