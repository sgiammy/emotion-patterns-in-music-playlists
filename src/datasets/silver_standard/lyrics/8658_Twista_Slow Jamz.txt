Are you gonna be?
Say that you're gonna bee

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

She said she wants some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita, will definitely set this party off right
(Are you gonna be, gonna Be, gonna be, gonna be, gonna be
(Well, well, well, well)

She said she wants some Ready For The World, some New Edition
Some Minnie Ripperton, will definitely set this party off right
(Are you gonna be, gonna Be, gonna be, gonna be, gonna be
(Well, well, well, well)

I told her to drive over in her new whip
Bring some friends you cool with
I'mma bring the Cool Whip
Then I want you to strip

Then you is my new chick
So we get our grind on
She be grabbin'
Callin' me Biggie like Shyne home

Man I swear she fine, homes
Why she always lying though
Tellin' me them diamonds
When she know they rhinestones

She got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
I played Ready For the World, she was ready for some action
My dawg said, "You ain't no freak, so you 'bout to prove my man wrong."

I'mma play this Vandross
You gon' take your pants off
I'mma play this Gladys Knight
Me and you gon' get it right

She said she wants some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita, will definitely set this party off right
(Are you gonna be, gonna Be, gonna be, gonna be, gonna be
(Well, well, well, well)

Got you lookin' at the gliss, at my hands and wrists
While I'm likely at smokin' on my canibus
When it come to rockin' original like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you ain' no messin' with Kan-man and Twist

From the Chi and I be sippin' Hennessy
Twistin A-marie
Try'na Smoke a B
Lookin' properly
Feelin' on a G
And always (well, well, well, well)

Come with me and sip on some regular champagne
You ain't know Twista can work it like The Whispers
Hit the stop light, get into some Isaac
The rims still moving, so I'm bumpin' a little Spinners

While I'm smokin' On a B
Dippin' through the streets
Bumpin' R&B and I got to leave
On the 23's
And I do it (well, well, well, well)

When my earth and the wind smoke a fire
Let my get your sheets wet listening to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze For Maze
Fulfilling our every sensation, slow jammin', having deep sex

You Ready For the World girl
Come on over, make me touch you all over your body, baby don't say no to me
And every moment you controllin' me, I'm lovin' the way you be
Holding me when I been listening to Jodeci

And when I come over and bend your ass
You be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass
I'da hit it from the back to the melody to roll it slow
Now I gotta go up in it fast, but I'mma finish last

No matter how much of a thug you see
I still spit it like it's R&B, o to the club with me
And with some Luther Come On and Hope
You finna and stilla be in love with me

Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers need to hold hands
And if you ain't got no man, hop up on my Brougham
I keep it pimpin' like an old man
You gots ta roll with the plan

'Cause after that then I
Take it to the dome
Then I got to bone
Stay up in the zone
Got to get you home
Gotta run up on
And I do it (well, well, well, well)

Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers need to hold hands
And if you ain't got no man, hop up on my Brougham
I keep it pimpin' like an old man
You gots ta roll with the plan

'Cause after that then I
Take you to my home
And we could get it on
Whisper on the phone
Just to get you goin'
Try'na make you moan
And I do it (well, well, well, well)
