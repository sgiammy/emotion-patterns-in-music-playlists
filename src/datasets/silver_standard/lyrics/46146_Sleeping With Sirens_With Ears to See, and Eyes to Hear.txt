True friends lie underneath
These witty words I don't believe
I can't believe a damn thing they say anymore

Lie, liar, you'll pay for your sins
Now, liar, I know all the places you've been

Forgiveness; this taste all but poisons my mouth
I scream but nothing, nothing will come out
(You've gone too far)

So tell me, how does it feel
How does it feel to be like you?
I think your mouth should be quiet
'Cause it never tells the truth

So tell me, so tell me why
Why does it have to be this way?
Why can't things ever change?

Falling over and over again
Oh, why does it have to be this way?

From the place I was, to the place I am, to the place I wanna be
For the mountains I've been climbing over and under and over

From the place that I was to the man I've become
I'll be there to see the tower you'll fall from
No, this kingdom isn't quite what it may seem
You're an illusion; you'll never be king

So tell me, how does it feel
How does it feel to be like you?
I think your mouth should be quiet
'Cause it never tells the truth

So tell me, so tell me why
Why does it have to be this way?
Why can't things ever change?

Sometimes things are better left unsaid
(True friends lie underneath)
(These witty words I can't believe)
But this time you'll get what you give
(I can't believe a damn thing they say anymore)

Come down, come down
Come down from your tower
Come down, come down
Come down from your tower

I know that for all my life, for all my strength
There is one above who can judge me
All I am is yours (All I am is yours)
All I am is yours (All I am is yours)
I am yours
