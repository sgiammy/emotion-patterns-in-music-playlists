You say all you need is consistent love
When I try I swear it's never enough - I messed up
Maybe this thing here just ain't meant for us
Baby you let go and I pull you back
I let go, you ain't having that

We do it like we rock stars
Sexin' in my hotel room, I be so loud
Higher than a smoke cloud
Shades on doin' 95 wit' the top down
I might sound crazy
'Cause we be goin' back and forth
One minute I hate you, then I love you
That's how it is

Till we get it right, we gon' fuck some more (till we get it)
Imma get it (imma get it), till we get it (till we get it)
Till we get it right, we gon' fuck some more (till we get it)
Imma get it (imma get it), till we get it (till we get it)

Why is it all so complicated
Baby this should be simple, it's drivin' me mental
But when you back it up it really drives me crazy
And you know what I'm into, make me forget what we arguin' about
Ayeeee

We do it like we rock stars
Sexin' in my hotel room, I be so loud
Higher than a smoke cloud
Shades on doin' 95 wit' the top down
I might sound crazy
'Cause we be goin' back and forth
One minute I hate you, then I love you
That's how it is

Till we get it right, we gon' fuck some more (till we get it)
Imma get it (imma get it), till we get it (till we get it)

Yo, he don't know me but he settin' up to blow me, uh
Said my Twitter pics remind him of Naomi, uh
On the low I used to holla at his homie, uh
Fuck it, now I'm about to ride him like a pony, yeah
Okay, thug prolly, yo come polly
He wanna fuck a bad Dolly and pop molly
I hope your pockets got a muthafuckin' pot belly
Or is it that you never ball? John Salley
He had the Rolls in the Royce, the tone in his voice
Don't want a good girl, now hoes is his choice
D-d-dick on H, pussy on W
Mouth on open, ass on smother you
Ass on the cover too, Elle Magazine
Vroom, vroom, vroom, get gasoline
Could I be your wife? Naw, we could bang though
I got these niggas whipped - call me the Django

Till we get it right, we gon' fuck some more (till we get it)
Imma get it (imma get it), till we get it (till we get it)
Till we get it right, we gon' fuck some more (till we get it)
