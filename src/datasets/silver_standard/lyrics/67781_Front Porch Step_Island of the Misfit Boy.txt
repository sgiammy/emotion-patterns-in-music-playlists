I love to sleep, 'cause I pretend that I'm dead
But I hate waking up 'cause it's hard to forget
That I've lost all control of this life that I've held so dear
And I wait for the bus but I'm not on the bench
I'm just spread across the ground making friends with cement
Hoping that the bus won't miss me when it comes my way

Well I made a few jokes but they said they weren't funny
I tried to force a smile but they said it was ugly
I tried to make a friend but no one was a friend to me
Poured my heart to a girl and it went on the floor
And I asked her what she wanted and she said she wanted more
I tried to find a lover, all I found was an enemy

Well I stand in front of the mirror and look at myself
And I don't make a sound but my eyes scream out help
And I start to struggle to hold myself back
From thrusting my head straight through the fucking glass
And I'm tired of falling for girls that don't care
And breaking my back to try to make them aware
That I'm more than depressed and their time won't be wasted
But I am just a broken boy that no one wants to play with

Now I'm lost in this hole and I'm sure I am stuck
And I can't run away 'cause I'm lazy as fuck
So I sit on the floor as I gather my thoughts
And they're full of broken promises that only piss me off
Well I lost control when I was only a boy
The world taught me angst when I deserved joy
Now I'm breaking down as I struggle to breathe
'Cause I believe in a god who won't believe in me

Well I stand in front of the mirror and look at myself
And I don't make a sound but my eyes scream out help
And I start to struggle to hold myself back
From thrusting my head straight through the fucking glass
And I'm tired of falling for girls that don't care
And breaking my back to try to make them aware
That I'm more than depressed and their time won't be wasted
But I am just a broken boy that no one wants to play with
