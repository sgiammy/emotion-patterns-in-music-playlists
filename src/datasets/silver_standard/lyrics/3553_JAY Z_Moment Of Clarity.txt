Whoo, chea, chea, chea
Turn tha music up turn the lights down I'm in my zone

Thank god for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty - the world'll feel my truths
Through my hard knock life time my gift and the curse
I gave you volume after volume of my work so you can feel my truths
I built the dynasty by bein one of the realest niggas out
Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt (Y'all can't fill my shoes)
From my Blueprint beginnings to my black album ending
If you listen close you'll hear what I'm about
Nigga feel my truths

Pop died didn't cry didn't know him that well
Between him doin' heroin and me doin' crack sales
Put that in an eggshell, standing at the tabernacle rather the church
Pretending to be hurt wouldn't work
So a smirk was all on my face
Like damn that man's face is just like my face
So pop I forgive you for all the shit that I lived through
I wasn't all your fault homie you got caught
Into the same game I fought
That uncle ray lost
My big brothers and so many others I saw
I'm just glad we got to see each other
Talk and re meet each other
Save a place in heaven for the next time we meet forever

The music business hate me cause the industry ain't make me
Hustlers and boosters embrace me and the music I be makin'
I dumbed down for my audience and double my dollars
They criticize me for it yet they all yell holla
If skillz sold truth be told,
I probably be - lyrically Talib Kweli
Truthfully I wanna rhyme like Common Sense
(But I did 5 mil) I ain't been rhymin like Common Sense
When your sense got that much in common and you been hustlin' since
Your inception fuck perception go with what make sense
Since I know what I'm up against we as rappers must decide what is most impor-tant
And I can't help the poor if I'm one of them
So I got rich and gave back to me that's a win win
So next time you see the homie and his rims spin
Just know my mind is workin just like them
(The rims that is)

My homie Sigel's on a tier where no tears should fall
'Cause he was on the block where no squares get off
See in my inner circle all we do is ball
Till we all got triangles on our walls
They just rappin' for the platinum
Y'all record, I recall 'cause I really been there before
4 scores a seven years ago prepare for flow
Prepare for war I should fear no man
But you don't hear me though
These words ain't just paired to go in one ear and out the other ear no
Yo my balls and my words is alls I have
What you gonna do to me nigga a scars'll scab
What you gonna box me home I could dodge a jab
3 shots couldn't touch me thank god for that
I'm strong enough to carry Biggie Smalls on my back
And the whole BK nigga holla back
