will.i.am:
Let me see your body rock
Shakin' it from the bottom-to-top
Freak to what the DJ drop
We be the ones to make it hot (to make it hot)
Electric shock, energy like a billion watts
Space be boomin', the speakers pop
Galactic combin' missed a spot
We bumpin' in your parking lot

Fergie:
When you're comin' up in the spot
Don't bring nothin' we call Pink Dot
'Cause we burnin' around the clock
Hit the lights and then turn them off
If you bring, that don't make you stop
Like the jungle, we run the block
No one rollin' the way we rock - way we rock

I wanna - I wanna rock right now

Rock that body, come on come on, rock that body
Rock that body, come on come on, rock that body (Rock your body)
Rock that body, come on come on, rock that body

Yeah, you could be big bone, long as you feel like your own
You could be the model type, skinny with no appetite
Short, stacked, black or white
Long as you do what you like
Body outta sight
