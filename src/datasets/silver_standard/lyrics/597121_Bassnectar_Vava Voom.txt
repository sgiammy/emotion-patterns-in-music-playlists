Vava Voom, into the room
This the tune
Bada-bing bada-boom

Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay,
Vava Voom, into the room
This the tune
Bada-bing bada-boom

Live my life on fast forward
Feet up on that dashboard
Hands up off that steering wheel
Call that shit a crash course
I ain't have to take no class for it
Nickname used to be Fast Porsche
Why I gotta be so bad for
A hundred times on that blackboard
Reminisce on my school days
Mama like LL Cool J's
Drunk off all them punches
He gon' need like two A's
(Ay, ay) Wake 'em up in like two days
Tell him he can have his bike back
But I really really like my new chain

Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay,
Vava Voom, into the room
This the tune
Bada-bing bada-boom

Live my life like I do
Her high heels on my side views
My eyes peeled for the 5-0
My horse power match my IQ
Light speed engage
My wifey's called 'gettin' paid'
My old chick was called 'minimum wage'
And my side piece is called 'getting a raise'
My wrist watch be so hypnotizing
My star ship be so enterprisin'
My transports be so energizing
We disappear when we next beside 'em
They love my verses, they memorize 'em
I don't even write 'em down, I improvise 'em
My ideas be IED's that West si-ide what I'm emphasizin' (let's go!)

Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay,
Vava Voom, into the room
This the tune
Bada-bing bada-boom
