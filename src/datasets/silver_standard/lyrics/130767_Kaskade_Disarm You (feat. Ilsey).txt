Let me disarm you
I'm not trying to own you
I just wanna know what it feels like
To have your body so close

Let me absolve you
Of the past that controls you
I just wanna know what you look like
Without a weight on your soul

I know somewhere we could get away
If you wanna find another place, love
Disappear and never leave a trace
I'll take you anywhere you want

So let me disarm you
There's an army I'm fighting around your heart
Let me disarm you
'Cause baby I just want to love who you really are
Who you really are

So let me disarm you
So let me disarm you

Spoken in silence
Blazing like sirens
I can bring you out of the darkness
Into the fiery light

I know somewhere we could get away
If you want to find another place, love
Disappear and never leave a trace
I'll take you anywhere you want

So let me disarm you
There's an army I'm fighting around your heart
Let me disarm you
'Cause baby I just want to love who you really are
Who you really are

So let me disarm you
Let me disarm you

So let me disarm you
There's an army I'm fighting around your heart
Let me disarm you
'Cause baby I just want to love who you really are
Who you really are
Let me disarm you
