It's like you're trying to get to heaven in a hurry
And the queue was shorter than you thought it would be
And the doorman says you need to get a wristband

You've got to lift between the pitfalls
But you're looking like you're low on energy
Did you get out and walk to ensure you'd miss the quicksand

Looking for a new place to begin
Feeling like it's hard to understand
But as long as you still keep peppering the pill
You'll find a way to spit it out again
And even when you know the way it's gonna blow
It's hard to get around the wind

Stretching out the neck on your evening
Trying to even out some deficit
But it's sabretooth multi-ball confusion
And you can shriek until you're hollow
Or whisper it the other way
Trying to save the youth without putting your shoes on

Looking for a new place to begin
Feeling like it's hard to understand
But as long as you still keep peppering the pill
You'll find a way to spit it out again
And even when you know the way it's gonna blow
It's hard to get around the wind

I can hear you through my window
But I'm never quite sure who is who
But they want the world on a dessert spoon
It always sounds like they're fighting
Or as if that's what they're about to do
It might not hurt now but it's going to hurt soon
