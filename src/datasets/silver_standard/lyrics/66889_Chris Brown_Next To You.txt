You've got that smile
That only heaven can make
I pray to God every day
That you keep that smile

You are my dream
There's not a thing I won't do
I'll give my life up for you
'Cause you are my dream

And baby everything that I have is yours
You will never go cold or hungry
I'll be there when you're insecure
Let you know that you're always lovely, girl
'Cause you are the only thing that I got right now

One day when the sky is fallin'
I'll be standing right next to you, right next to you
Nothing will ever come between us
'Cause I'll be standing right next to you, right next to you

If you had my child
You would make my life complete
Just to have your eyes on a little me
That'd be mine forever

And baby everything that I have is yours
You will never go cold or hungry
I'll be there when you're insecure
Let you know that you're always lovely, girl

'Cause you are the only thing that I got right now

One day when the sky is fallin'
I'll be standing right next to you, right next to you
Nothing will ever come between us
I'll be standing right next to you, right next to you

We're made for one another
Me and you
And I have no fear
I know we'll make it through

One day when the sky is fallin'
I'll be standing right next to you

One day when the sky is fallin'
I'll be standing right next to you, right next to you
Nothing will ever come between us
I'll be standing right next to you, right next to you

Stand by my side, side, side
When the sky, falls, down
I'll be there, I'll be there
You've got that smile
That only heaven can make
I pray to God every day
To keep you forever
