"With the perfect hair
And the perfect wife
And the perfect kids
And the perfect life
I will finally be somebody"

Let's play born-again American, resistance is the game!

Two pigs wearing suits brought the news
That I'm wanted by the bank
They say the rent is due
Ceaser's on to you
So you better remember your place

Then they outsourced my job and gave a raise to my boss
Bailed out the banks, but billed me for the loss
They say we must submit and be one with the machines
'Cause the kingdom of fear needs compliance to succeed

So waterboard the kids for fun, it's all the rage
And play born-again American, reistance is the game
Smash the control machine
Work, buy, consume, die
Smash the control machine
Happy little slaves for minimum wage

"The revolution will be monetized and streamed live via renegade wi-fi"

The clinic said I'm sick, toxic and impure
But there isn't any cure for the poor or uninsured
So we live our digital lives on multiple screens
And we forget that the blood of the workers grease the machines
In the psalm of the fiends, love discriminates
While the fat cats feed the rats their dose of daily cake

So waterboard the kids for fun, it's all the rage
And play born-again American, resistance is the game

Smash the control machine
Work, buy, consume, die
Smash the control machine
Happy little slaves for minimum wage
Smash the control machine
Work, buy, consume, die
Smash the control machine
Haters, betrayers, liars and thieves

She sold her soul for designer clothes
For the perfect lips and the perfect nose
The winner in the end always owns the most
Reality TV told her so

Money changer, greedy banker, this is the people's house
My minister has a sinister plan to save my soul with a credit card scam
Exploitation is contagious for the selfish and self-inflated
Start a war, use the poor, watch our profits soar and soar

We've become a nation of wolves, ruled by sheep
Owned by swine, overfed and put to sleep
And while the media elite decrees what to think
I am wide awake, on the edge and on the brink

So when Atlas shrugs, and the fountainhead bleeds
And when Wall Street apostles preach a gospel of greed
I'll renounce the fame of this glutinous age
And be a born-again American, resistance is to blame

Smash the control machine
Work, buy, consume, die
Smash the control machine
Haters, betrayers, liars and thieves
Smash the control machine
A nation of wolves, ruled by sheep

Exploitation is contagious
Exploitation is contagious
Exploitation is contagious
Exploitation...
