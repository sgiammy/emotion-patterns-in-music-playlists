Humanity, cover me with the ashes of remembrance
I will learn from this pain
There is no darkness without light to teach us of ourselves
Humanity, cover me with the ashes of remembrance
I will learn from this pain

Life to lifeless to eternity
Life to lifeless, the cycle repeats

Death unfolds itself painfully to unmask how fragile we are
Death unfolds itself painfully, teacher of sanity

The pain drags me down, I'll rebuild me
The pain drags me down, I'll rebuild me

Humanity, cover me with the ashes of remembrance
I will learn from this pain

Life to lifeless to eternity
Life to lifeless, the cycle repeats
Life to lifeless to eternity
Life to lifeless, the cycle repeats

Life to lifeless to eternity
Life to lifeless, the cycle repeats
