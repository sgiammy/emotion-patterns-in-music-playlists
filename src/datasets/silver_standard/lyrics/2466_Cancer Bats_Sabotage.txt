I can't stand it, I know you planned it
I'ma set it straight, this Watergate
I can't stand rockin' when I'm in here
'Cause your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear

So, while you sit back and wonder why
I got this fucking thorn in my side
Oh, my God, it's a mirage
I'm tellin' y'all, it's sabotage

So, so, so, so listen up 'cause you can't say nothin'
You shot me down with a push of your button
But yo, I'm out and I'm gone
I'll tell you now I keep it on and on

'Cause what you see you might not get
And we can bet, so don't you get souped yet
Scheming on a thing that's a mirage
I'm tryin' to tell you now, it's sabotage

Listen all of y'all, this is sabotage
Listen all of y'all, this is sabotage
Listen all of y'all, this is sabotage
Listen all of y'all, this is sabotage

I can't stand it, I know you planned it
I'ma set it straight, this Watergate
I can't stand rockin' when I'm in this place
'Cause I feel disgrace 'cause you're all in my face

But make no mistakes and I switch up my channel
I'm Buddy Rich when I fly off the handle
What could it be, it's all a mirage
You're scheming on a thing that's sabotage
