We could just go home right now
Or maybe we could stick around
For just one more drink, oh yeah
Get another bottle out
Let's shoot the breeze
Sit back down
For just one more drink, oh yeah

Here's to us
Here's to love
All the times
That we messed up
Here's to you
Fill the glass
Cause the last few days
Have gone too fast
So lets give 'em hell
Wish everybody well
Here's to us
Here's to us

We stuck it out this far together
Put our dreams through the shredder
Let's toast cause things got better
And everything could change like that
And all these years go by so fast
But nothing lasts forever

Here's to us
Here's to love
All the times
That we messed up
Here's to you
Fill the glass
Cause the last few nights
Have gone too fast
If they give you hell
Tell 'em to forget themselves
Here's to us
Here's to us

Here's to all that we kissed
And to all that we missed
To the biggest mistakes
That we just wouldn't trade
To us breaking up
Without us breaking down
To whatever's come our way

Here's to us
Here's to us!

Here's to us
Here's to love
All the times
That we messed up
Here's to you
Fill the glass
Cause the last few days
Have gone too fast
So let's give 'em hell
Wish everybody well
Well!

Here's to us
Here's to love
All the times
That we messed up
Here's to you
Fill the glass
Cause the last few nights
Have gone too fast
If they give you hell
Tell 'em forget themselves
Here's to us
Here's to us
Oh, here's to us
Here's to us
Here's to us
Here's to love (Here's to us)
Wish everybody well
Here's to us
Here's to love
Here's to us
Here's to us
