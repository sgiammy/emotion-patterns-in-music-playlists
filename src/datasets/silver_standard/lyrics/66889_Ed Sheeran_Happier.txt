Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new

'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
That I know I was happier with you
(Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah)

Sat on the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?
(Hey yeah, hey yeah)

Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you (Hey yeah, hey yeah)
But ain't nobody need you like I do (hey yeah, hey yeah)
I know that there's others that deserve you (hey yeah, hey yeah)
But my darling, I am still in love with you

But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
(Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah)
(Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah)
(Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah)
(Hey yeah, hey yeah, hey yeah)

'Cause baby, you look happier, you do
I knew one day you'd fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I'll be waiting here for you
