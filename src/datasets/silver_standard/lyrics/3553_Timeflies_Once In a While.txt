I thought I would know better
That's wishful thinkin'
Thought there'd be no pressure
That's wishful drinkin'
Is anything forever or just a feeling?
What have I been so afraid of?
I don't know

From Brooklyn to New York, then off to the West
In Cali, no Khaled, but fuck, we the best
My stripes, stay American, lemme express
And I keep it as live as a Total Request
Then they ask me these questions
Like, "How do you do it?
Press and the road and the music"
Truth is, I'm always up, I'm always down
Worry about everyone else

But once in a while, I catch myself
Once in a while, I ask myself
What am I doing?
Once in a while, I need your help
But once in a while I feel like
I just wanna dance
I feel good, I feel good
I feel good, I feel good

I live life like my blood type, B positive
These days something got me feeling quite the opposite
Music like my heroin, but all I hear is poppy shit
Time to get up off of it and watch somebody copy it
I'm West bound down and out
Feeling fake now like somebody found me out
Need to slow down, I'm brownin' out
So many thoughts, lemme drown 'em out

Yeah, I thought I would know better
That's wishful thinkin'
Thought there'd be no pressure
That's wishful drinkin'
Is anything forever or just a feeling?
What have I been so afraid of?
I don't know

But once in a while, I catch myself
Once in a while, I ask myself
What am I doing?
Once in a while, I need your help
But once in a while I feel like
I just wanna dance
I feel good, I feel good
I feel good, I feel good

I've been looking at where we're going
There's no slowin' down to go back
And thinking of where we've been
No one's ever been given a road map
Say "Slow down, turn here, graduate and work here
Come and get a raise when you finish up your first year"
No, if you're doing it, you're doing it right
Keep it movin', now tell me what you're doing tonight
Cause sometimes we're up, sometimes we're down
Don't worry about anyone else

But once in a while, I catch myself
Once in a while, I ask myself
What am I doing?
Once in a while, I need your help
But once in a while I feel like
I just wanna dance
I feel good, I feel good
I feel good, I feel good
