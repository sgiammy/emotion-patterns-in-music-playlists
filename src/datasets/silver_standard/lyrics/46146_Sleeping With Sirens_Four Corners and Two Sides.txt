You! x2
Tell me how has it taken so long for me to open up my eyes?
How has it taken so long for me to finally realize?
And when they all turn against you, you better be prepared to fight.

They say I'm a sinner, but nobody knows.
You only do what you're told, you better hope that you're right.
They say I'm a sinner. I'm not the only one.
You want to point your finger, you better make a choice tonight.
'Cause I'll stand up for what is right.

How has such a bitter person become a man I am?
Tell me how, how am I to change when I'm still trying to figure out how to be saved?
And when they all turn against you, try not to look the other way.

They say I'm a sinner, but nobody knows.
You only do what you're told, you better hope that you're right.
They say I'm a sinner. I'm not the only one.
You want to point your finger, you better make a choice tonight.
'Cause I'll stand up for what is right.

You, you better choose your side, make a choice tonight.

They say I'm a sinner, but nobody knows.
You only do what you're told, you better hope that you're right.
They say I'm a sinner. I'm not the only one.
You want to point your finger, you better make a choice tonight.
'Cause I'll stand up for what is right.
