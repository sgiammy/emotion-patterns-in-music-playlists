Just open up like a page in a book
These words that I'm writing won't be misunderstood
If I'm dishonest bring me back to my knees
Show me why I'm even able to speak

I'll testify, please help me to see
Don't close your eyes, keep your eyes on me
Open up, open up now
So make me strong

There's blood on my hands
But the killer's not my enemy
It's all for the sake of love
It's all for you

When all we know is falling, I'll save something for you
You who are all alone (All alone)
When everything is beautiful, when everything's okay
Even if it's not okay, I'll say it's all for you

For you
For you
For you
For you
For you and only you

These hands hold up nothing but scars underneath (Scars underneath)
From swimming these oceans and learning to breathe (Learning to breathe)
So often I tell them, so often they listen to me
So make me strong

There's blood on my hands
But the killer's not my enemy
It's all for the sake of love
It's all for you

When all we know is falling, I'll save something for you
You who are all alone (All alone)
When everything is beautiful, when everything's okay
Even if it's not okay, I'll say it's all for you

For you
For you
For you
For you
For you and only you

I can feel it in my fingertips (I can feel)
And I can taste it in the air
(And I'm hoping there's someway I can follow)
I know somehow, there's something new

I see it so clearly

I can feel your hands on my fingertips
I'm seeing oh so clear and I know it's for you
I see so clear

(It's all for you)

When all we know is falling, I'll save something for you
You who are all alone (All alone)
When everything is beautiful, when everything's okay
Even if it's not okay, I'll say it's all for you

For you
For you
