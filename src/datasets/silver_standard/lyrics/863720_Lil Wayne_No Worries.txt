You can look me in my face (I ain't got no worries, I ain't got no worries, I ain't got no worries)
See the shrooms keep me up (I ain't got no worries, I ain't got no worries, I ain't got no worries)
You see money right there, yeah that's Tunechi right there (turn up)
Yeah that's Mack Maine right there, and we ain't got no worries
You see pussy right there redbone mangos right there
See them shroomies right there we ain't got no worries

Tunechi in this bitch, e'rybody should be worried
Them pussy niggas be purring, bitches be digging me I feel buried
And if she make this dick hard, she woke up a sleeping giant
Man your bitch speak in tongues every time we speak in private

Hope your barber shop open 'cause we got hair triggers
Smoke so much that Smokey the Bear have to bear with us
And that Jeep with the doors off that means that bitch sleek
All these bitches think they're the shit, I sent them up shit's creek

You see Tunechi right here, give me brain ideas
It's okay if you turn up just don't turn off my light years
All I know is I do it what I'm smoking I grew it
These are Blood gang Piru, all rats gotta die even Stewart

On my private jet is my stewardess is your bitch nigga, bitch nigga
I know gold diggers and ditch diggers
You don't get dissed, you get disfigured
She sorry I didn't shave so that pussy is a little furry
I put that pussy in my face I ain't got no worries
Tunechi

You can look me in my face (I ain't got no worries, I ain't got no worries, I ain't got no worries)
See the shrooms keep me up (I ain't got no worries, I ain't got no worries, I ain't got no worries)
You see money right there, yeah that's Tunechi right there (turn up)
Yeah that's Mack Maine right there, and we ain't got no worries
You see pussy right there redbone mangos right there
See them shroomies right there we ain't got no worries

We ain't got no worries
She bad as a hooker, so she ain't got no worries
She want me to eat her sugar, I say why you in a hurry
She say why you asking questions, I say bitch you trynna be funny

Now take your fucking clothes off, let me see your Donkey Kong
I swing your ass back and forth, back and forth on my monkey bars
That camel toe, that camel toe, no worries, no pantyhose
These niggas falling off like baggy clothes, I smoke more than a magic show

I swear I saw my ho, I swear she was with my ho
You know I fuck them both, sore pussy and sore throat
Bitch it's Tunechi and I'm out here, no worries no worries
I would talk about my dick, but man that shit would be a long story

You can look me in my face (I ain't got no worries, I ain't got no worries, I ain't got no worries)
See the shrooms keep me up (I ain't got no worries, I ain't got no worries, I ain't got no worries)
You see money right there, yeah that's Tunechi right there (turn up)
Yeah that's Mack Maine right there, and we ain't got no worries
You see pussy right there redbone mangos right there
See them shroomies right there we ain't got no worries
