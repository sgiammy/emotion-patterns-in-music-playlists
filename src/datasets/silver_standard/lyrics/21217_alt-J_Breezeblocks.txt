She may contain the urge to run away
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
Cetirizine, your fever's grip me again
Never kisses all do you ever send are full stops

Do you know where the wilds things go?
They go along to take your honey
Break down now, weep, build up breakfast now
Let's eat my love, my love, love, love, la la la la

Muscle to muscle and toe to toe
The fear has gripped me but here I go
My heart sinks as I jump up
Your hand grips hand as my eyes shut

Do you know where the wild things go?
They go along to take your honey
Break down, let's sleep, build up breakfast now
Let's eat my love, my love, my love

She bruises, coughs, she splutters pistol shots
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
She's morphine, queen of my vaccine
My love, my love, love, love, la la la la

Muscle to muscle and toe to toe
The fear has gripped me but here I go
My heart sinks as I jump up
Your hand grips hand as my eyes shut

She may contain the urge to run away
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
Germolene disinfect the scene, my love, my love, love, love
But please don't go, I love you so, my lovely

Please don't go, please don't go, I love you so, I love you so
Please don't go, please don't go, I love you so, I love you so
Please break my heart (hey)
Please don't go, please don't go, I love you so, I love you so
Please don't go, please don't go, I love you so, I love you so
Please break my heart, ah ha

Please don't go, I'll eat you whole
I love you so, I love you so, I love you so
Please don't go I'll eat you whole
I love you so, I love you so, I love you so, I love you so
Please don't go, I'll eat you whole
I love you so, I love you so, I love you so
Please don't go I'll eat you whole
I love you so, I love you so, I love you so, I love you so
Please don't go, I'll eat you whole
I love you so, I love you so, I love you so
Please don't go, I'll eat you whole
I love you so, I love you so, I love you so, I love you so
Please don't go, I'll eat you whole
I love you so, I love you, so I love you so
Please don't go, I'll eat you whole
I love you so, I love you so, I love you so
