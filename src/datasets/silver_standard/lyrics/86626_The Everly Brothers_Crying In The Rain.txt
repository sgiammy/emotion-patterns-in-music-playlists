I'll never let you see 
The way my broken heart is hurtin' me 
I've got my pride and I know how to hide 
All my sorrow and pain 
I'll do my cryin' in the rain 

If I wait for cloudy skies 
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes 
You'll never know that I still love you so 
Though the heartaches remain 
I'll do my cryin' in the rain 

Rain drops fallin' from heaven 
Could never wash away my misery 
But since we're not together 
I look for stormy weather 
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see 

Some day when my cryin's done 
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun 
I may be a fool but till then darling you'll 
Never see me complain 
I'll do my cryin' in the rain 

I'll do my cryin' in the rain 
I'll do my cryin' in the rain
