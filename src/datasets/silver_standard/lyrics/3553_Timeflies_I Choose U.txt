Late nights, New York, trouble on my mind;
Crossed town to the west end, I'm wasting my time.
Down south, back roads, dust clouds the air.
Chevrolet, in the back seat, but it wasn't there.
Missed the flight out of Heathrow, got stuck up in a one room flat.
'Cause she's so fit tryna hold me down, while I was just trying to get back.
Malibu, beach blonde, crashing on these shores.
Had a smile shining like gold, but that smile wasn't yours.
And I know, I know, I know, I know...

Everybody needs somebody to love.
Everybody needs somebody to love.
And I choose you.
Yeah ahhyeah
I choose you.
I told ya, everybody needs somebody to love.
Everybody needs somebody to love.
And I choose you.
(You know I choose you, wouldn't ever want to lose you)
And I choose you.
And I choose you-u-u-u-u-u-u.
And I choose you-u-u-u-u-u-u.


High heels, dirty talk, hand cuffs and chains.
Nails down my back, but I never knew her name.
Bright eyes, sun dress, daddy's little girl.
She changed my life, but you changed my world.
And I know, I know, I know, I know...

Everybody needs somebody to love.
Everybody needs somebody to love.
And I choose you.
You know I choose you
I choose you.
You know I choose you
Everybody needs somebody to love.
Everybody needs somebody to love.
And I choose you.
And I choose you.
And I choose you-u-u-u-u-u-u.
And I choose you-u-u-u-u-u-u.

You're every place that I've been baby, you're every face that I've seen;
You're everywhere and I'm going crazy, your body rockin' my dreams;
You're always up in my mind, you're everywhere that I go;
You're everything in this time, so girl I'm lettin you know;
That I'm rolling up in a fly whip, come ride this and just close your eyes;
Showin up with my sidekick, my, superhero with a dope disguise;
No wonder woman, all our dreams are coming true;
So don't be scared of losing me, because I'm always choosing you.

Everybody needs somebody to love.
Everybody needs somebody to love.
And I choose you.
(I choose you)
I choose you.
(You know I choose you, I could never loose you)
And I choose you-u-u-u-u-u-u.
And I choose you-u-u-u-u-u-u.
Everybody needs somebody to love.
And I choose you-u-u-u-u-u-u.
I need somebody to lo-o-o-ove.
I need somebody to lo-o-o-ove.
And if you need somebody to love, then I choose you.
