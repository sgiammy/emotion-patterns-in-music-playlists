La, la, la la la, la, la, la la la

I wrote her off for the tenth time today
And practiced all the things I would say
But she came over, I lost my nerve
I took her back and made her dessert

Oh, I know I'm being used
That's okay, man, 'cause I like the abuse
I know she's playing with me
That's okay, 'cause I got no self esteem

Oh way oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah

We make plans to go out at night
I wait till two, then I turn out the light
This rejection's got me so low
If she keeps it up I just might tell her so

Oh way oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah

When she's saying, oh that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she's saying, oh that I'm like a disease
Then I wonder how much more I can stand
Well, I guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think it's better this way
The more you suffer, the more it shows you really care
Right? 
Yeah!

Now, I'll relate this little bit
It happens more than I'd like to admit
Late at night she knocks on my door
She's drunk again and looking to score

Now, I know I should say no
But it's kind of hard when she's ready to go
I may be dumb, but I'm not a dweeb
I'm just a sucker with no self esteem

Oh way oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah

When she's saying, oh that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she's saying, oh that I'm like a disease
Then I wonder how much more I can stand
Well, I guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think it's better this way
The more you suffer, the more it shows you really care
Right? 
Yeah!
