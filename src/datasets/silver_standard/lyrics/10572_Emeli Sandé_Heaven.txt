Will you recognize me
In those flashing lights?
I try to keep my heartbeat
But I can't get it right

Will you recognize me
When I'm lying on my back?
Something's gone inside me
And I can't get it back

Oh heaven, oh heaven
I wait with good intentions
But the day, it always lasts too long
Then I'm gone

Oh heaven, oh heaven
I wait with good intentions
But the day, it always lasts too long
Then I'm gone

Then I'm gone
Then I'm gone, then I'm gone
Then I'm gone, then I'm gone
Then I'm gone, then I'm gone

Will you recognize me
When I'm stealing from the poor?
You're not gonna like me
I'm nothing like before

Will you recognize me
When I lose another friend?
Will you learn to leave me
Or give me one more try again?

Oh heaven, oh heaven
I wait with good intentions
But the day, it always lasts too long
Then I'm gone

Oh heaven, oh heaven
I wait with good intentions
But the day, it always lasts too long
Then I'm gone

Then I'm gone
Then I'm gone, then I'm gone
Then I'm gone, then I'm gone
Then I'm gone, then I'm gone

Oh heaven, oh heaven
I wait with good intention
Oh heaven, oh heaven
I wait with good intention

Oh heaven, oh heaven
I wait with good intention
You say that you're away
I try but always break
'Cause the day always lasts too long

Then I'm gone, then I'm gone
Then I'm gone, then I'm gone
Then I'm gone, then I'm gone
Then I'm gone

Then I'm gone, then I'm gone
Then I'm gone, then I'm gone
Then I'm gone, then I'm gone
Then I'm gone, then I'm gone
