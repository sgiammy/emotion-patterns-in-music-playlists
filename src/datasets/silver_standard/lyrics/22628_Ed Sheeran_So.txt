Filled up with doubt
I have to move home
But I want to stay with you
For all of the summer
I have my plan
That you won't remember
If you want to see the world
Then please ask your mother
I cannot hold your hand
To watch you go
I am a liar
As you might know
I need you now
I need your touch
And your lips
I need that smile
And your kiss

You're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so
You're so

I see your grace
From my window
When it is late at night
It'll show me your shadow
I'm in my place
Hope you remember
When summer's gone
I'll still sing a song
Of you in September
I cannot hold your hand
To watch you go
I am a liar
As you might know
I need you now
I need your touch
And your lips
I need that smile
And your kiss

You're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so
You're so

These words I say mean
You're so amazing
I've noticed lately
I need you, maybe

You're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so
You're so
