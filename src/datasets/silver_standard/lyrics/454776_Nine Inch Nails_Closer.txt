You let me violate you
You let me desecrate you
You let me penetrate you
You let me complicate you

Help me, I broke apart my insides
Help me, I've got no soul to sell
Help me, the only thing that works for me
Help me get away from myself

I want to fuck you like an animal
I want to feel you from the inside
I want to fuck you like an animal
My whole existence is flawed
You get me closer to God

You can have my isolation
You can have the hate that it brings
You can have my absence of faith
You can have my everything

Help me, you tear down my reason
Help me, it's your sex I can smell
Help me, you make me perfect
Help me become somebody else

I want to fuck you like an animal
I want to feel you from the inside
I want to fuck you like an animal
My whole existence is flawed
You get me closer to God

Through every forest
Above the trees
Within my stomach
Scraped off my knees

I drink the honey
Inside your hive
You are the reason
I stay alive

Precursor

Through every forest
Above the trees
Within my stomach
Scrapped off my Knees

Help me get away

You let me violate you
You let me desecrate you
You let me penetrate you
You let me complicate you

I broke apart my insides
Help me get away from myself
The only thing that works for me
Help me become somebody else
