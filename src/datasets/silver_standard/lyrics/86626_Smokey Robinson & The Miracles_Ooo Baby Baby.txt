Ooh la la la la
I did you wrong
My heart went out to play
But in the game I lost you
What a price to pay
Hey, I'm crying

Ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby

Mistakes
I know I've made a few
But I'm only human
You've made mistakes too
I'm crying

Ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby

I'm just about at
The end of my rope
But I can't stop trying
I can't give up hope

'Cause I feel that one day
I'll hold you near
Whisper, "I still love you"
Until that day is here
I'm crying

Ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby
