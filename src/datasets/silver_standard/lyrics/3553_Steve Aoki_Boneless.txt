Hey, you got me woke up
The way you roll that
Sticky like okra
Just let me coach ya
Show you 'bout my coacher
It's the late night show like Oprah
Ditch the party, it ain't over
Don't ham it, and grab your friend by the hand
Let me know is you down,
Body like me play at ya
I might make that fly at ya
How we'll know if you don't play fair?
But I think of you and your girl
Just gimme some of that!

We stand, out to the sun up
Twisting and burn up
Can't nobody stop us
We're gone delirious
Out to the sun up
Twisting and burn up
Can't nobody stop us
We're gone delirious
La la la la la la
Gimme some of that
Gimme some of that
Gimme some of that
We're gone delirious!
La la la la la la
Come and take a ride
Take it all night, who cares?

We on sunset into the sun up
I got my girls here
Where? So don't you run up
It could get ugly
Think I need a wing man
I'm straight from California, smelling like the weed man
