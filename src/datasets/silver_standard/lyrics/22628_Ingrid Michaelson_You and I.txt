Don't you worry there, my honey 
We might not have any money 
But we've got our love to pay the bills 
Maybe I think you're cute and funny 
Maybe I wanna do what bunnies do with you 
If you know what I mean 

Oh, let's get rich and buy our parents homes in the South of France 
Let's get rich and give everybody nice sweaters and teach them how to dance 
Let's get rich and build a house on a mountain 
Making everybody look like ants from way up there, 
You and I, you and I 

Well, you might be a bit confused 
And you might be a little bit bruised 
But baby, how we spoon like no one else 
So I will help you read those books 
If you will soothe my worried looks 
And we will put the lonesome on the shelf 

Oh, let's get rich and buy our parents homes in the South of France 
Let's get rich and give everybody nice sweaters and teach them how to dance 
Let's get rich and build a house on a mountain 
Making everybody look like ants from way up there, 
You and I, you and I 

Oh, let's get rich and buy our parents homes in the South of France 
Let's get rich and give everybody nice sweaters and teach them how to dance 
Let's get rich and build a house on a mountain 
Making everybody look like ants from way up there, 
You and I, you and I
