I know this man
Who tries and tried as hard as he can
Can not and will not be a one woman man
Your little plan
It isn't working I couldn't give a damn
But who do you think that your tryna scam

It's just a little bit suspicious
How you never give me hugs or kisses
Do you give them to your other misses?
I bet you do
It's just a little bit suspicious
How you never have have a common interest
I gave you love and all I got were disses
So we are through

Who the hell are you
To put me through the things that you put me through
What must you get off on making your girls cry
I am what did I do
Is it all the shit that we went through
Well I've got my eyes on a better lookin' guy

It's just a little bit suspicious
How you never give me hugs or kisses
Do you give them to your other misses?
I bet you do
It's just a little bit suspicious
'Cause you never have have a common interest
I gave you love and all I got were disses
So we are through

I put my part in it you took my heart
Now I'm gonna show you how it feels
All the things that you put me through
You did me wrong
But, I am so much stronger
Than any girl you screwed
So tell me what in hell are you gonna do (Whoa)

It's just a little bit suspicious
How you never give me hugs or kisses
Do you give them to your other misses?
I bet you do
It's just a little bit suspicious
How you never have have a common interest
I gave you love and all I got were disses
So we are through

I know this man
Who tries and tried as hard as he can
Cannot and will not have another woman
