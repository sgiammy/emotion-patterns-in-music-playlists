I'm feeling mean today
Not lost, not thrown away
Just irritated and quite hated
Self control breaks down

Why's everything so tame?
I like my life insane
I'm barricading and debating
Who I'm gonna kick around

Right now, can't find a way to get across the hate when I see you
Right now, I feel it scratch inside, I wanna slash and beat you
Right now, I rip apart the things inside that excite you
Right now, I can't control myself, I fucking hate you

I'm feeling cold today
Not hurt, just fucked away
I'm devastated and frustrated
God I feel so bound

So when I feel the need
I think it's time to bleed
I'm gonna cut myself
A watch the blood
Hit the ground

Right now, can't find a way to get across the hate when I see you
Right now, I feel it scratch inside, I wanna slash and beat you
Right now, I rip apart the things inside that excite you
Right now, I can't control myself, I fucking hate you

You open your mouth again
I swear I'm gonna break it
You open your mouth again
My God I cannot take it

Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up

Right now, can't find a way to get across the hate when I see you
Right now, I feel it scratch inside, I wanna slash and beat you
Right now, I rip apart the things inside that excite you
Right now, I can't control myself, I fucking hate you

I fucking hate you, I fucking hate you
I fucking hate you, I fucking hate you!
I fucking hate you 
(Shut up)
I fucking hate you 
(Shut up) 
I fucking hate you
(Shut up, shut up)
