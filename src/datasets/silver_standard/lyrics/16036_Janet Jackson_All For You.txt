Shakin' that thing like you never did see
Got a nice package alright
Guess I'm gonna have to ride it tonight

Edit (4, 3, 2, 1) (chicka ah)

It's all for you
If you really want it
It's all for you
If you say you need it

It's all for you
If you gotta have it
It's all for you if you make a move
It's all for you

I see you staring out the corner of my eye
You seem uneasy, want to approach me, throw me a line
But then something inside you grabs you, says, "Who am I?"
I know exactly 'cause it happens with all the guys

So you, so what you gonna do?
Come on and talk to me
Promise you won't even have an attitude
I'll let you sit right next to me

Don't join the list with the other fools
That ain't the way to be
Yes, it's cool, yes, I'm in the mood
Intimidations got that mind, yeah

It's all for you
If you really want it
It's all for you
If you say you need it

It's all for you
If you gotta have it
It's all for you if you make a move
It's all for you (Chicka ah...)

Tell me I'm the only one
It's all for you
Soon we'll be having fun
It's all for you
Come over here and get some 
It's all for you if you make a move
It's all for you

Can't be afraid or keep me waiting for too long
Before you know it, I'll be outta here, I'll be gone
Don't try to be all clever, cute or even sly
Don't have to work that hard
Just be yourself and let that be your guide

So you, so do what you gonna do?
So, come on and talk to me by
Promise you won't even have an attitude
I'll even let you sit right next to me

Don't join the list with the other fools
That ain't the way to be, boy
Yes, it's cool, yes, I'm in the mood
Intimidations every time

It's all for you (chicka ah)
If you really want it
It's all for you
