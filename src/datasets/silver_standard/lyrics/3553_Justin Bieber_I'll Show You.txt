My life is a movie
And everyone’s watching
So let’s get to the good part
And passed all the non-sense

Sometimes it’s hard to do the right thing
When the pressures is coming down like lightening
It’s like they want me to be perfect
When they don’t even know that I’m hurting
'Cause life’s not easy
I’m not made out of steel
Don’t forget that I’m human, don’t forget that I’m real
Act like you know me, but you never will
There’s one thing I know for sure

I’ll show you
I’ll show you
I’ll show you
I'll show you

I’ve got to learn things
Learn them the hard way
Got to see what it feels like
No matter what they say

Sometimes it’s hard to do the right thing
When the pressures is coming down like lightening
It’s like they want me to be perfect
When they don’t even know that I’m hurting
'Cause life’s not easy
I’m not made out of steel
Don’t forget that I’m human, don’t forget that I’m real
Act like you know me, but you never will
There’s one thing I know for sure

I’ll show you
I’ll show you
I’ll show you
I'll show you

'Cause life’s not easy
I’m not made out of steel
Don’t forget that I’m human, don’t forget that I’m real
Act like you know me, but you never will
There’s one thing I know for sure

I’ll show you

I’ll show you
