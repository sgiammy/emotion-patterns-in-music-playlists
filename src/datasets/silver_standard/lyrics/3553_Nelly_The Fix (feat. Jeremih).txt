Yeah, Mustard on the beat ho
Shawty hit me on the late night
Got a man, got me thinking, shawty, ain't right
She say she ain't about the creep life
But all she wanna do is take pipe
I ain't mad at nobody
I just wanna have your body
Now, I can give you the key, girl
Or you can meet me in the lobby

Talking 'bout it
Oh, I'll lay you down and go down
Girl, till I reach your ocean

So come and get this dick
When you need that fix, yeah, that medicine
I know you like it like this
When you get that itch, adrenaline
Heart beating outta your chest
Heart beating outta yo chest
And when that pressure's building
I got what you need, come fuck with me
And when you get that feeling
I got sexual healing
Baby

Talking bout
Baby
Bust it open every time I get up inside
Soaking wet, turn the bed to a slip 'n' slide
Spread eagle, nigga eating like it's suppa time
Shawty knows who's is it, it's all mine
I ain't mad at nobody no
I just wanna have your body

And if you can take it deep
Then let a nigga like me, get at that body girl
Oh, I'll lay you down and go down

Girl, till I reach your ocean

So come and get this dick
When you need that fix, yeah, that medicine
I know you like it like this
When you get that itch, adrenaline
Heart beating outta your chest
Heart beating outta yo chest
And when that pressure's building
I got what you need, come fuck with me
And when you get that feeling
I got sexual healing

Baby
Talking bout

Sweat 'em all out
Baby
I can't hold it much longer
Baby
I'm getting stronger and stronger
When you need that fix, yeah, that medicine
I know you like it like this
When you get that itch, adrenaline
Heart beating outta your chest
Heart beating outta yo chest
And when that pressure's building
I got what you need, come fuck with me
And when you get that feeling
I got sexual healing
Baby
