Say your prayers, little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the Sandman he comes

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never Never Land

Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never Never Land
Yeah-heah!

Now I lay me down to sleep
(Now I lay me down to sleep)
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
(Pray the Lord my soul to keep)
If I die before I wake
(If I die before I wake)
Pray the Lord my soul to take
(Pray the Lord my soul to take)

Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head

Exit light
Enter night
Grain of sand
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never Never Land

Boooooo!
Yeah, yeah!
Yo oh!

We're off to Never Never Land (Take my hand)
We're off to Never Never Land (Take my hand)
We're off to Never Never Land
We're off to Never Never Land
We're off to Never Never Land
