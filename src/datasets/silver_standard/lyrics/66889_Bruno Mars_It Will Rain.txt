If you ever leave me, baby
Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have, we don't have it anymore

There's no religion that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor, ohohoho
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'
Will keep you by my side, will keep you from walkin' out the door

'Cause there'll be no sunlight if I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies if I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds my eyes will do the same
If you walk away every day it will rain, rain, rain, heyeyey

I'll never be your mother's favorite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
Ooohooohooo, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing
Sayin': "There goes my little girl walkin' with that troublesome guy"

But they're just afraid of something they can't understand
Ooh, but, little darlin', watch me change their minds
Yeah, for you I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try
I'll pick up these broken pieces till I'm bleeding if that'll make you mine

'Cause there'll be no sunlight if I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies if I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds my eyes will do the same
If you walk away every day it will rain, rain, rain, heyeyey

Don't just say (Don't just say) goodbye (Goodbye)
Don't just say (Don't just say) goodbye (Goodbye)
I'll pick up these broken pieces till I'm bleeding if that'll make it right

'Cause there'll be no sunlight if I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies if I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds my eyes will do the same
If you walk away every day it will rain, rain, rain, heyeyey
