Mmm hmmm
Hmm, hmm, hmm, mmm hmmm
Someday we'll be together
Oooh ahh, say it, say it, say it, say it again (you tell 'em)
Someday we'll be together
Oh yeah, oh yeah

You're far away
From me my love (sing it babe)
And just as sure my, my baby
As there are stars above
Wanna say, wanna say, wanna say it

Someday we'll be together
Mmmm, ahhh, yes we will, yes we will (say it)
Someday we'll be together
Some sweet day
Ahh, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

My love is yours, baby
Oh, right from the start (really mean it hon')
You, you, you possess my soul now honey
And I know, I know you own my heart
And I wanna say it (t-tell her)

Someday we'll be together
Some sweet day
Ahhh, yes we will, yes we will
Someday we'll be together
Tell everybody now
Ahhh, yes we will, yes we will

A long time ago, now, now sweet thing
I made a big mistake, honey (it's true babe, say it)
I, say I, said goodbye (bye, bye, bye, bye, bye)
Oh, oh baby
Ever, ever and ever and ever and ever (ever, ever)
Ever since that day now, now (ever since that day)
All I, all I wanna do, oh is cry, cry, ahhh 
(All I wanna do, all I wanna do, cry, cry, cryyyy)
Hey, hey, hey

I long for you (oh yes now babe) 
Every, every night
Ohh, just to kiss your sweet, sweet lips, baby
Hold you ever, ever so tight
And I wanna say it (say it)

Someday we'll be together
Ahh, yes we will, yes we will
Someday we'll be together
Ahh, yes we will, yes we will (my love)
Someday we'll be together
Ahh, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey
Someday we'll be together
Ahh, yes we will, yes we will
