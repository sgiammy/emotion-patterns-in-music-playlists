I dig my toes into the sand
The ocean looks like a thousand diamonds
Strewn across a blue blanket

I lean against the wind
Pretend that I am weightless
And in this moment I am happy, happy

I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here

I lay my head onto the sand
The sky resembles a backlit canopy
With holes punched in it

I'm counting UFOs
I signal them with my lighter
And in this moment I am happy, happy

I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
Wish you were here

The world's a roller coaster
But I am not strapped in
Maybe I should hold with care
But my hands are busy in the air saying

I wish you were here
I wish you were

I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
Wish you were here
