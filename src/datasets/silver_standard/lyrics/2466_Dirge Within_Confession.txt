Now the smoke is clearing I can see what I've become
A mere shadow of my innocence, a memory of mother's son
A false solution for a product of mistakes
Wash away of all the sins so they don't lead me to my grave

The struggle inside of me
The only way is to start again

This is my confession
My soul is screaming
As the walls are closing in
The endless aggression is my only friend
It's the one that lives within
This is my confession

Staring in the eyes of demons that infect my past
Write my name in blood and see if the infection lasts
Done too many things, can't apologize for all this pain
On my knees
Scream into the night will someone save me?!

The struggle inside of me
The only way is to start again

This is my confession
My soul is screaming
As the walls are closing in
The endless aggression is my only friend
It's the one that lives within
This is my confession

Kill the voices in my head

This is my confession
My soul is screaming
As the walls are closing in
The endless aggression is my only friend
It's the one that lives within
This is my confession...
