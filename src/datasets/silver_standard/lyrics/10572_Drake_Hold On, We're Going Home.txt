I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly

'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home

I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly

'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home

You're the girl, you're the one
Gave you everything I loved
I think there's something, baby
I think there's something, baby

'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be

Just hold on we're going home
Just hold on we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on we're going home
