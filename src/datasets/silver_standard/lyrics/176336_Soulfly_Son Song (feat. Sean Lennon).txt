Sometimes I don't want to face life
Sometimes I feel empty inside
But every moment is precious
And everyone will turn to dust

Dust myself up and I scream at the sky
It's been so hard but I can't let it die
Turn my head up, looking at the stars
So many years, I still wonder where you are?
Dust myself up and I scream at the sky
It's been so hard and I ask myself why?
Turn my head up, looking at the sun
Waited so long, it's time to move on, move on

Look at the sun, look at the sky
Another day, another sign
And every moment is precious
And everything will turn to dust

Dust myself up and I scream at the sky
It's been so hard but I can't let it die
Turn my head up, looking at the stars
So many years, I still wonder where you are?
Dust myself up and I scream at the sky
Every day I ask myself why?
So much pain pouring from inside
Above me I feel the spirit fly
