I thought I had it all together
But I was led astray
The day you walked away
You were the clock
That was ticking in my home
Changed my state of mind
When love's so hard to find

Your feelings changed like the weather
They went from clear to gray
On that cloudy day
How can I go on
Without falling apart
Love's so hard to find
When someone's on your mind

Listen baby
Your wish is my command
Baby won't you understand
That your wish is my command
What can I do to make my baby understand

Something tells me that I'm dreaming
Cause I can see us there
Waving unaware
Of problems that have a tendency to keep
Keep the truth confined
Far from our minds

You need someone you can believe in
This I do declare
Trust me I'll be there
The road that leads to heaven can be so steep
I will help you climb
Change your state of mind

Listen baby
Your wish is my command
Baby won't you understand
That your wish is my command
What can I do to make my baby understand
Your wish is my command
Baby won't you understand
That your wish is my command

(I can see us there
Waving unaware
This I do declare
Trust me I'll be there) x 3
