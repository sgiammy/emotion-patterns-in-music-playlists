Stitched you up, put you together
With cotton and feather
Gave you love, put my heart inside you
Oh, what could I do

When you started talking in your sleep
Saying things you'd do to me?
I didn't care, I wasn't scared
Now I'm finding knives under the sheets
Crumbled photographs of me
I'm in despair, should I be scared?

Teddy bear, you were my teddy bear
You were comforting and quiet, how did love become so violent?
Oh, teddy bear, you were my teddy bear
Everything was so sweet until you tried to kill me

I threw you out, I didn't outgrow you
I just didn't know you
But now you're back, it's so terrifying
How you paralyze me

Now you're showing up inside my home
Breathing deep into the phone
I'm so unprepared, I'm fucking scared

Teddy bear, you were my teddy bear
You were comforting and quiet, how did love become so violent?
Teddy bear, you were my teddy bear
Everything was so sweet until you tried to kill me

I'm fucking scared...

Teddy bear, you were my teddy bear
You were comforting and quiet, how did love become so violent?
Teddy bear, you were my teddy bear
Everything was so sweet until you tried to kill me
