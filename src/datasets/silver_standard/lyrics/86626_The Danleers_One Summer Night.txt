One summer night, we fell in love
One summer night, I held you tight
You and I, under the moon of love, moon of love

One summer night, I kissed your lips
One summer night, I held you close
You and I, under the moon of love

You kissed me oh, so tenderly
And I knew this was love
And I as held you, oh so close
I knew no one could ever take your place, oh

One summer night, we fell in love
One summer night, I held you tight
You and I, under the moon of love, moon of love.
