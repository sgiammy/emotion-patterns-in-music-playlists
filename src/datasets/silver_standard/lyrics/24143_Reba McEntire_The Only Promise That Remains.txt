When the ground beneath you starts a-shakin'
And you forget the place we came from
When you're lost and lookin' for you're way home
You're way home to me
I'll come out and find you
When the world around you starts a-movin'
And you should wonder if I still love you
If you feel the darkness comin', risin' inside
I'll make a light to guide you back home

And after all the sky is fallin' down
And after all the water's washed away
My love's the only promise that remains

When your doubts have got you thinkin'
Nothing's ever really sacred
And you're afraid you might believe in...
Believe in me

And I'll give you a reason
'Cause the world around us keeps on movin'
And there's no doubt that I still love you
So when you feel the darkness comin', risin' inside
I'll make a light to guide you back home

And after all the sky is fallin' down
And after all the water's washed away
My love's the only promise that remains
My love's the only promise that remains
My love's the only promise that remains

And after all the sky is fallin' down
(After all the sky is fallin' down)
And after all the water's washed away
(After all the water's washed away)
My love's the only promise that remains
