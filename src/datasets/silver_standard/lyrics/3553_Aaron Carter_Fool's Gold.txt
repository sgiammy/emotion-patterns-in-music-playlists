She livin' in this lie with him
No more coffee in the morning
I'm wide awake while he sleeping in

Know that's why you're calling

You woke up chasing feelings, healing, trouble dealing
Coping with the fact that you're alone
It makes you miss my body, touchin', kissin', squeezin'
He don't know your worth, your weight in gold

Look at you fallin'
Do you even know what you're fallin' for?
'Cause I see you fallin'
You traded my heart for some fool's gold
Fool's gold

Can't think about your nights with him
Wearing nothing but the moonlight
When you feel your conscience stepping in
Uber to my house but

I don't need this pressure, you're my greatest stressor
Panties on my bed, where they come from?
Show up uninvited, fuckin' up my vibes with
All the shit that you pretend you want

Look at you fallin'
Do you even know what you're fallin' for?
'Cause I see you fallin'
You traded my heart for some fool's gold
Fool's gold

Fool's gold
Fool's gold
Fool's gold
Fool's gold

Look at you fallin'
Do you even know what you're fallin' for?
'Cause I see you fallin'
You traded my heart for some fool's gold

Look at you fallin'
Do you even know what you're fallin' for?
'Cause I see you fallin'
You traded my heart for some fool's gold
Fool's gold
