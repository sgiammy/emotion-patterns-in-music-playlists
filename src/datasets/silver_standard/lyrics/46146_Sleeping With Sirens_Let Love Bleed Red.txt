Is it naive to make plans that seem
So far away? There's a reason I feel this way
You're sleeping alone, I'm awake
Will you dream of me tonight, am I close to where you are?

Lay me down and tell me everything will be alright
Things will be alright
Lay me down and tell me everything will be alright
Things will be alright

This could mean everything or nothing at all
You take what is real, I'll give you my all

Is it naive to make plans that seem
So, so, so far?
I think, "Let's not wait
Let's love right now, let's love right now"

Lay me down and tell me everything will be alright
Things will be alright
Lay me down and tell me everything will be alright
Things will be alright

Oh, here where we lie, outstretched to wonder why we don't belong
You deserve much more and I'll give until I'm all gone
Forever know your face and ever take your place here by my side
Like a ghost into night

The poisoned apple to my bite
I'll be the shadow at your door
I'll be the moth into your light
'Cause you deserve much more

Yeah, you deserve much more

Lay me down, tell me everything will be alright
Things will be alright
Thunder storms could never shake us
Lay me down and kiss me like things will be alright
Everything will be alright

This could mean everything or nothing at all
You take what is real, I'll give you my all
This could mean everything or nothing at all
You take what is real, I'll give you my all
