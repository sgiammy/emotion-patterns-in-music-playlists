I'm staring at the glass in front of me
Is it half empty?
Have I ruined all you've given me?
I know I've been selfish
I know I've been foolish
Look through that and you will see
I'll do better
I know, baby, I can do better

If you leave me tonight, I'll wake up alone
Don't tell me I can make it on my own
Don't leave me tonight
This heart of stone will sink 'til it dies

Sometimes I stare at you while you are sleeping
I listen to your breathing
Amazed how I somehow managed to
Sweep you off your feet girl
Your perfect little feet, girl
I took for granted what you do
I'll do better
I know, baby, I can do better

If you leave me tonight, I'll wake up alone
Don't tell me I can make it on my own
Don't leave me tonight
This heart of stone will sink 'til it dies

And don't you know my heart is pumpin'
Oh, it's putting up a fight
And I've got this feeling
That everything's alright
Don't you see?
I'm not the only one for you
But you're the only one for me

If you leave me tonight, I'll wake up alone...

(Stay)
If you leave me tonight
(Close)
I'll wake up alone
(Don't)
Don't tell me I can
(Go)
Make it on my own
(Stay)
Don't leave me tonight
(Close)
This heart of stone
(Don't)
Will sink 'til it dies
(Go)
If you leave me tonight

Don't leave me tonight
