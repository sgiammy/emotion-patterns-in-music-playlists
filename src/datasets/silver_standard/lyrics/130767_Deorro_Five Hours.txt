Please, don't hold me back
Please, don't hold me back, no

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We found some time
To break each other's heart, yeah
You said "Don't look back
And find the road to follow, yeah."

Please, don't hold me back
Please, don't hold me back, no

You said "Don't look back
And find the road to follow behind."

Please, don't hold me back
Please, don't hold me back, no!
