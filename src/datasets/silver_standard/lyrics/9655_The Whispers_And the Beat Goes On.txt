And the beat goes on
Just like my love (everlasting)
And the beat goes on
Still moving strong (on and on)

Do you ever wonder
That to win somebody's got to lose
I might as well get over (the blues)
Just like fishing in the ocean
There'll always be someone new
(Who loves me better)
You did me wrong
But I've been through stormy weather

And the beat goes on
Just like my love (everlasting) oh
And the beat goes on (better believe it)
Still moving strong (on and on)

Don't stop for nobody
This time I'll keep my feet on solid ground
Now I understand myself (when I'm down)
Like the sweet sound of hit music
There'll always be something new
(To keep the tables turning)
Hey, keep singin' a song
Cause there'll never be an ending

And the beat goes on (hey, yeah)
Just like my love (everlasting) oh
And the beat goes on
Still moving strong (on and on)

The beat goes on (the beat goes on)
The beat goes on
The beat goes on (the beat goes on)
The beat goes on
Huh

Get down playing that feel
Be sure the beat is real

The beat goes on

(Do you ever wonder) Well
That to win somebody's got to lose
I might as well get over (the blues)
Just like fishing in the ocean
There'll always be someone new
(Who loves me better)
Girl, you did me wrong
But I've been through stormy weather

And the beat goes on (yeah, yeah)
Just like my love (everlasting) hey
And the beat goes on (ooh)
Still moving strong (and I love it)

And the beat goes on (keep moving, keep moving, right on)
Just like my love (everlasting) oh
And the beat goes on
(Just like my love, babe, just like my love, my love, baby)
(On and on)

And the beat goes on

Don't stop the grooving
Don't stop the grooving

And the beat goes on
(Ooh, just like my love) (everlasting) (hoo)
And the beat goes on (got to make it last)
Still moving strong (and I love it)
(Better believe it, baby)

And the beat goes on
(And the beat goes on and on and on)
Just like my love (everlasting) oh
And the beat goes on (got to believe it, baby)
Still moving strong (and I love it)

And the beat goes on
(Just my love, babe, just like my love, baby) (everlasting)
And the beat goes on
Still moving strong (and I love it)

The beat goes on (the beat goes on)
The beat goes on
The beat goes on (the beat goes on)
The beat goes on
The beat goes on (the beat goes on)
The beat goes on
The beat goes on (the beat goes on)
The beat goes on

And the beat goes on
Just like my love (everlasting) oh
And the beat goes on
Still moving strong

And the beat goes on
Just like my love (everlasting) oh
And the beat goes on
Still moving strong (and I love it)

And the beat goes on
Just like my love (everlasting) oh
And the beat goes on
