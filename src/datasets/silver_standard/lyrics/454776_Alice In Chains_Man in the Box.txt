I'm the man in the box
Buried in my shit
Won't you come and save me? Save me

Feed my eyes, can you sew them shut?
Jesus Christ, deny your maker
He who tries, will be wasted
Oh feed my eyes, now you've sewn them shut

Ow
Ow

I'm the dog who gets beat
Shove my nose in shit
Won't you come and save me? Save me

Feed my eyes, can you sew them shut?
Jesus Christ, deny your maker
He who tries, will be wasted
Oh feed my eyes, now you've sewn them shut

Feed my eyes, can you sew them shut?
Jesus Christ, deny your maker
He who tries, will be wasted
Oh feed my eyes, now you've sewn them shut
