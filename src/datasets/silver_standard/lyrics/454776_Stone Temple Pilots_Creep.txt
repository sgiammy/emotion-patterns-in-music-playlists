Forward yesterday
Makes me wanna stay
What they said was real
Makes me wanna steal
Livin' under house
Guess I'm livin', I'm a mouse
Alls I gots is time
Got no meaning, just a rhyme

Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal, I like to steal

I'm half the man I used to be
This I feel as the dawn, it fades to gray
I'm half the man I used to be
This I feel as the dawn, it fades to gray
I'm half the man I used to be
This I feel as the dawn, it fades to gray
Well, I'm half the man I used to be
Half the man I used to be

Feelin' uninspired
Think I'll start a fire
Everybody run
Bobby's got a gun
Think you're kinda neat
Then she tells me I'm a creep
Friends don't mean a thing
Guess I'll leave it up to me

Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand
Guess I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal, I like to steal

I'm half the man I used to be
This I feel as the dawn, it fades to gray
I'm half the man I used to be
This I feel as the dawn, it fades to gray
I'm half the man I used to be
This I feel as the dawn, it fades to gray
I'm half the man I used to be
Half the man I used to be

Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand
Guess I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand
'Cause it likes to heal, I like to steal

I'm half the man I used to be
This I feel as the dawn, it fades to gray
I'm half the man I used to be
This I feel as the dawn, it fades to gray
I'm half the man I used to be
This I feel as the dawn, it fades to gray
I'm half the man I used to be
Half the man I used to be
Half the man I used to be
Half the man I used to be
