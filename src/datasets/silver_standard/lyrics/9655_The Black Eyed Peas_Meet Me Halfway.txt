Oooooo...
I can't go any further than this
Oooooo...
I want you so badly, it's my biggest wish

Cool,
I spend my time just thinking, thinking, thinking 'bout you
Every single day, yes, I'm really missing, missing you
And all those things we used to, used to, used to, used to do
Hey girl, wassup, it used to, it used to be just me and you
I spend my time just thinking, thinking, thinking 'bout you
Every single day, yes, I'm really missing, missing you
And all those things we used to, used to, used to... (Used to do)
Hey girl wassup,
Yo, wassup, wassup, wassup

Fergie
Can you meet me halfway, right at the borderline
That's where I'm gonna wait...for you
I'll be looking out, night and day
Took my heart to the limit
And this is where I'll stay
I can't go any further than this
I want you so bad, it's my only wish

will.i.am
Girl, I travel around the world and even sail the Seven Seas
Across the universe, I go to other galaxies
Just tell me where to go, just tell me where you wanna meet
I navigate myself-myself to take me where you be
'Cause girl I want, I-I-I want you right now
I travel uptown-town, I travel downtown
Wanna have you around-round, like every single day
I love you always-ways, I'll meet you halfway

Fergie
Can you meet me halfway, right at the borderline
That's where I'm gonna wait...for you
I'll be looking out, night and day
Took my heart to the limit
And this is where I'll stay
I can't go any further than this
I want you so bad, it's my only wish
I can't go any further than this
I want you so bad, it's my only wish

Taboo
Let's walk the bridge to the other side
Just you and I (Just you and I)
I will fly, fly the skies, for you and I (For you and I)
I will try, until I die, for you and I
For you and I  (For you and I)
For-for-for you and I (For you and I)
For-for-for-for you and I (For you and I)
For-for-for you and I (For you and I)
(For you and I)

Fergie
Can you meet me halfway
Can you meet me halfway
Can you meet me halfway
Can you meet me halfway

Meet me halfway, right at the borderline
That's where I'm gonna wait...for you
I'll be looking out, night and day
Took my heart to the limit
And this is where I'll stay
I can't go any further than this
I want you so bad, it's my only wish
I can't go any further than this
I want you so bad, it's my only wish
