Well, I had me a boy, turned him into a man
I showed him all the things that he didn't understand, whoa
And then I let him go

Now, there's one in California who's been cursing my name
'Cause I found me a better lover in the UK, hey hey
Until I made my getaway

One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
'Cause I'm the best baby that they never gotta keep
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
They always wanna come, but they never wanna leave

Ex's and the oh's, they haunt me
Like a-ghosts, they want me
To make 'em all
They won't let go
Ex's and oh's

Had a summer lover down in New Orleans
Kept him warm in the winter, left him frozen in the spring, my my
How the seasons go by

I get high and I love to get low
So the hearts keep breaking and the heads just roll, you know
That's how the story goes

One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
'Cause I'm the best baby that they never gotta keep
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
They always wanna come, but they never wanna leave

Ex's and the oh's, they haunt me
Like a-ghosts, they want me
To make 'em all
They won't let go

My ex's and the oh's, they haunt me
Like a-ghosts, they want me
To make 'em all
They won't let go
Ex's and oh's

One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
Climbing over mountains and a-sailing over seas
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
They always wanna come, but they never wanna leave

My ex's and the oh's, they haunt me
Like a-ghosts, they want me
To make 'em all
They won't let go

Ex's and the oh's, they haunt me
Like a-ghosts, they want me
To make 'em all
They won't let go
Ex's and oh's
