She's a yellow pair of running shoes, an' a holey pair of jeans
She looks great in cheap sunglasses, she looks great in anything
She's I want a piece of chocolate, take me to a movie
She's I can't find a thing to wear, now and then she's moody

She's a Saturn with a sunroof, with her brown hair a-blowing
She's a soft place to land, and a good feeling knowing
She's a warm conversation, that I wouldn't miss for nothing
She's a fighter when she's mad, and she's a, lover when she's loving

And she's, everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her I go on and on and on
'Cause she's, everything to me

She's a Saturday out on the town, and a church girl on Sunday
She's a cross around her neck, and a cuss word 'cause it's Monday
She's a bubble bath and candles, baby come and kiss me
She's a one glass of wine, and she's feeling kinda tipsy

She's the giver I wish I could be, and the stealer of the covers
She's a picture in my wallet, of my unborn children's mother
She's the hand that I'm holding, when I'm on my knees and praying
She's the answer to my prayer, and she's the song that I'm playing

And she's, everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
I talk about her I go on and on and on
'Cause she's, everything to me

She's the voice I love to hear, and someday when I'm ninety
She's that wooden rocking chair, I want rocking right beside me
Every day that passes, I only love her more
Yeah she's the one, that I'd lay down my own life for

And she's, everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
She's everything to me
Yeah she's, everything to me

Everything I ever wanted
And everything I need
