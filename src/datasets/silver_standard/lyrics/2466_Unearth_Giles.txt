Smother his life
The words cut right to the heart
Disease and threaten my family name
An epic stand is made
Condemned I will not plead
Damned to the beast of torment
Damned by the beast within us all

Crushed by the the fear
More stone, more stone, more weight for Corey

Not one set forth could capture admission of guilt
By law, avoids death on Gallows Hill
Through time this fight will martyr my name
My soul free of a heretic

Crushed by the the fear
More stone, more stone, more weight for Corey

Court of Ayer and Terminer leave me my rightful land
Men of Ayer and Terminer leave me my rightful land
To stow in my heart, leave to my sons

Peine Forte et Dure is called, an effort to collapse belief
Has failed, and surely will die with me
An epic stand is made
Condemned I will not plead
Damned to the beast of torment
Damned by the beast within us all

Rectify my name
Rectify my name
Rectify my name
Rectify my name
Rectify my name
