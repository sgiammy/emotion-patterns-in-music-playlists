Nelly: Am I throwing you off?
Timbaland: Nope
Nelly: Didn't think so

Timbaland: How you doin' young lady?
That feelin' that you givin' really drives me crazy
You don't have to play about the joke
I was at a loss of words first time that we spoke

You lookin' for a girl that'll treat you right
You lookin' for her in the daytime with the light

You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night

You expect me to just let you hit it
Will you still respect me if you get it?

All I can do is try, give me one chance
What's the problem? I don't see no ring on your hand
I be the first to admit it
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent

You wanna get in my world, get lost in it
Boy I'm tired of running, let's walk for a minute

Promiscuous girl
Wherever you are
I'm all alone
And it's you that I want

Promiscuous boy
You already know
That I'm all yours
What you waiting for?

Promiscuous girl
You're teasing me
You know what I want
And I got what you need

Promiscuous boy
Let's get to the point
'Cause we're on a roll
Are you ready?

Roses are red, some diamonds are blue
Chivalry is dead, but you're still kind of cute

Hey, I can't keep my mind off you
Where you at, do you mind if I come through?

I'm out of this world, come with me to my planet
Get you on my level do you think that you can handle it?

They call me Thomas, last name Crown
Recognize game, I'mma lay mine's down

I'm a big girl, I can handle myself
But if I get lonely I'mma need your help
Pay attention to me I don't talk for my health

I want you on my team
So does everybody else

Shh, baby we can keep it on the low
Let your guard down ain't nobody gotta know

If you with it girl, I know a place we can go
What kind of girl do you take me for?

Promiscuous girl
Wherever you are
I'm all alone
And it's you that I want

Promiscuous boy
You already know
That I'm all yours
What you waiting for?

Promiscuous girl
You're teasing me
You know what I want
And I got what you need

Promiscuous boy
Let's get to the point
'Cause we're on a roll
Are you ready?

Don't be mad, don't get mean
Don't get mad, don't be mean
Don't be mad, don't get mean
Don't get mad, don't be mean

Wait, I don't mean no harm
I can see you with my t-shirt on

I can see you with nothing on
Feeling on me before you bring that on

(Bring that on?) You know what I mean
Girl, I'm a freak, you shouldn't say those things

I'm only trying to get inside your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say

It's okay, it's alright
I got something that you gon' like

Hey is that the truth or are you talking trash?
Is your game M.V.P. like Steve Nash?

Promiscuous girl
Wherever you are
I'm all alone
And it's you that I want

Promiscuous boy
I'm calling your name
But you're driving me crazy
The way you're making me wait

Promiscuous girl
You're teasing me
You know what I want
And I got what you need

Promiscuous boy
We're one and the same
So we don't gotta play games no more
