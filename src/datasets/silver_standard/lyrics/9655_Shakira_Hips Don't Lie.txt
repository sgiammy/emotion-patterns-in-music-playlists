Ladies up in here tonight
No fighting, no fighting
We got the Refugees up in here
No fighting, no fighting
Shakira, Shakira

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man wants to speak Spanish
Como se llama, si, bonita, si, mi casa, su casa
Shakira, Shakira

Shakira
Oh baby, when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body

And I'm on tonight 
You know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see baby, this is perfection

Wyclef Jean
Hey girl, I can see your body moving 
And it's driving me crazy
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing

And when you walk up on the dance floor
Nobody cannot ignore the way you move your body, girl
And everything so unexpected, the way you right and left it
So you can keep on taking it

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man want to speak Spanish
Como se llama, si, bonita, si, mi casa, su casa
Shakira, Shakira

Shakira
Oh baby, when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body

And I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie
And I am starting to feel you boy
Come on let's go, real slow
Don't you see baby, asi es perfecto

Oh I know I am on tonight, my hips don't lie
And I am starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see baby, this is perfection
Shakira, Shakira

Oh boy, I can see your body moving
Half animal, half man
I don't, don't really know what I'm doing
But you seem to have a plan

My will and self restraint 
Have come to fail now, fail now
See, I am doing what I can, but I can't so you know
That's a bit too hard to explain

Baila en la calle de noche
Baila en la calle de día
Baila en la calle de noche
Baila en la calle de día

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man want to speak Spanish
Como se llama, si, bonita, si, mi casa, su casa
Shakira, Shakira

Shakira
Oh baby when you talk like that
You know you got me hypnotized
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body

Wyclef Jean
Señorita, feel the conga
Let me see you move like you come from Colombia

Mira en Barranquilla se baila así, say it
Mira en Barranquilla se baila así

Yeah
She's so sexy every man's fantasy a refugee like me
Back with the Fugees from a third world country
I go back like when Pac carried crates for humpty humpty
I need a whole club dizzy

Why the CIA wanna watch us? Colombians and Haitians
I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction 
No more do we snatch ropes 
Refugees run the seas 'cause we own our own boats 

Shakira
I'm on tonight, my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you boy
Come on let's go, real slow
Baby, like this is perfecto

Oh, you know I am on tonight and my hips don't lie
And I am starting to feel it's right
The attraction, the tension
Baby, like this is perfection

No fighting
No fighting
