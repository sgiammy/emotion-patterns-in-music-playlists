In the still of the night
I held you
Held you tight
'Cause I love
Love you so
Promise I'll never
Let you go
In the still of the night
(In the still of the night)

I remember (I remember)
That night in May (I remember)
The stars (I remember)
Were bright above (I remember)
I'll hope (I remember)
And I'll pray (I remember)

To keep
Your precious love
Well before the light
Hold me again
With all of your might
In the still of the night

So before the light
Hold me again
With all of your might
In the still of the night
In the still of the night
