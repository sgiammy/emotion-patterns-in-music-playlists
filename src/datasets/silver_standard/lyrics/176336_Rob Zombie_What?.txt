I wanna know who you were meeting in the cemetery
I don't have to tell you anything

All right

My human duplicators
Prehistoric women and
Jack the Ripper said
What?

She married a monster
On the very last day
She turned around and said
What?

I was a teenage
A something or other
With a Judge Five man
What?

Vampire lovers in a wild bikini say
Uh-huh, u-huh, uh-huh, u-huh

Cannibal man and a jungle girl say
Uh-huh, u-huh, uh-huh, u-huh

Let's go

Like a son of Kong
Like a Fu Manchu
They do not know what to do
What?

I got a vulture
With a rabid eye and
Killer bees screaming
What?

A real mastermind
A genius of somekind
But I do not understand
What?

Vampire lovers in a wild bikini say
Uh-huh, u-huh, uh-huh, u-huh

Cannibal man and a jungle girl say
Uh-huh, u-huh, uh-huh, u-huh

Uh, let's do it

Midnight offerings
In a mini skirts and
Mr. Rock N Roll

Uh, Satan's cheerleaders
Bouncing pom poms
Bouncing pom poms

Rave on with me
Rave on with me
Rave on with me
Here we go

Vampire lovers in a wild bikini say
Uh-huh, u-huh, uh-huh, u-huh

Cannibal man and a jungle girl say
Uh-huh, u-huh, uh-huh, u-huh

Rave on with it
Rave on with it
Rave on with it
On and on

Rave on with it
Rave on with it
Rave on with it
On and on
