Here's your chance, do your dance
(Shake it!)
(Drop) drop down and shake it

All right, I count it, I show it
I take it out and I throw it
Them real niggas is here and know everybody know it
Boy, I got these girls wildin' from 19 to like 40 something
You're not Disick, like Kourtney husband
I'm more than drunk 'cause I had a shot of that vodka
I had a shot of that Henny, I got contact from that Mary
Your girl gave me some Remy and now she poppin' that thing for me
And lookin' like she want it, B-O-W-O-K-T-A-N-E
Instagram in the morning, girl
Come through bring her and them, too, do not bring your man with you
Nickname that na-na trouble now let's see how much I get into
I'm Oktane, that's Pricetag and Weezy, well you know him
So Sundays at Greystone, shots on me well let's go then

Here's your chance, do your dance
(Shake it!)
(Drop) drop down and shake it

Ugh, take them clothes of, that's a fashion statement
I get behind that ass, we drag racing
Suck my pipe, swallow my crack babies
Dirty dancing, rest in peace Patrick Swayze
Get your ho and don't you stunt
I make her knees weak, four more make a month
She blow my dick like a blunt
She shakin' like shake John
She make her ass clap
Thank you, thank you very much
Pop that pussy lil mama
Do your lil dance with your beautiful ass
Hoes sweat me like glands
Now shake that ass girl, shake that ass girl
Ass like a dump truck, Truk the world
Tunechi...

Here's your chance, do your dance
(Shake it!)
(Drop) drop down and shake it

Uh, one time, uh
Pull up, ten chains on, fur coat nigga
Rest in peace to all you broke niggas
When it come to paper yeah we got the most with us
So rest in peace to all you broke niggas
All the girls jock us, beast, daily knockas
Middle of the stage middle finger to the coppas
Wait, heard your mama white but your daddy black
Well that explains that long hair and how that booty clap
Black girl got knowledge, my white girl attended college
Spanish girl, she like it fast, I call her Speedy Gonzales
My black girl said "don't be sittin' down if you a freak" (go 'head)
I said "get up out that seat" (go 'head)
"And practice what you preach" (go 'head)

Here's your chance, do your dance
