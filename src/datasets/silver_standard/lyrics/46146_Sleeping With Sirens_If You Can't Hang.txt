Met a girl at seventeen,
Thought she meant the world to me,
So I gave her everything,
She turned out to be a cheat.

Said she'd been thinkin' for a long time,
And she found somebody new,
I've been thinking that this whole time.

Girl, I never thought you'd stay,
But that's okay,
I hope he takes your filthy heart,
And then he throws it away someday.

Before you go,
There's one thing you oughta know.

If you can't hang, then there's the door, baby.
If you can't hang, then there's the door, baby.
If you can't hang, then there's the door, baby.
If you can't hang, then there's the door.

I don't wanna take your precious time,
'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, face,
But you turned into a pretty big waste of my time.
I don't wanna take up all your time,
'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, face,
But you turned into a pretty big waste of my time.

You're the lowest type,
You're the lowest.

I met a girl stuck in her ways,
She found a boy she knew she'd change.
I changed my clothes, my hair, my face,
To watch us go our separate ways.

She said we'd grown apart for some time,
But then she found somebody new,
I hope Mr. Right puts up with all the bullshit that you do.

Stay the hell away while I sit here by myself,
And figure out how I got this way.

Before you go,
There's one thing you oughta know.

If you can't hang, then there's the door, baby.
If you can't hang, then there's the door, baby.
If you can't hang, then there's the door, baby.
If you can't hang, then there's the door.

I don't wanna take your precious time,
'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, face,
But you turned into a pretty big waste of my time.
I don't wanna take up all your time,
'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, face,
But you turned into a pretty big waste of my time.

I don't want to get this confused,
She said she'd never settle for some boy she couldn't use.
So now I gotta call the doctor,
So we can prescribe me medication,
So I can deal with all the memories of being near this way.

I met a girl at twenty-three,
Knew she meant the world to me,
So I gave her everything,
And she did the same for me.
Imagine that!

'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty face,
Girl, you're such a pretty, pretty face, whoa
'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty face,
No you're such a pretty, pretty face.

I don't wanna take your precious time,
'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, face,
But you turned into a pretty big waste of my time.
I don't wanna take up all your time,
'Cause you're such a pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, face,
But you turned into a pretty big waste of my time.

Would you please stay and come inside, baby?
Would you please stay and please be mine, baby?

Would you please stay and come inside, baby?
Would you please stay and please be mine.
