Feeling so uncut
I can barely get the words out of my mouth
And I see you walking up and all these clouded apparitions
They fade out

Tell myself just breathe, just breathe you in
Just breathe
I won't let you leave, don't leave me here
Don't you know I need you now?

Feels like
We both know the night has ended
Daylight
Finds me feeling almost gone

It feels like
You could stop my bones from bending
Around and around
You're turning my world upside down

I've got you stuck on mind
And it's driving me crazy
It's driving me crazy

Won't let her get to me
Bury this fantasy that I'm living in
But then every face I see, she's staring right back at me
And I need her now

I've got you stuck on my mind
And it's driving me crazy
