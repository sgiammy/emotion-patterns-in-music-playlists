There's glass in the park
Darling, I can't help but keep
Making appointments to sweep 
Beneath the climbing frame

If the sun's in your eyes
I'll tighten your blindfold, baby
Don't worry, your foot won't get cut
Strut carelessly

And when you say that you need me tonight
I can't keep my feelings in disguise
The white parts of my eyeballs illuminate

And I'll wait for you
As if I'm waiting for a stone to stop
I've heard them talking
About how I'm gonna put you off

There's glass in the park
And now that I'm up off my knees
I've picked up the speed
To jump your palaces

And I shoot through the night
And suddenly all those once lost
Concoctions froth
And chase the day away

When you say that you need me tonight
I can't keep my feelings in disguise
The white part of my eyeball illuminates

And I'll wait for you
As if I'm waiting for the stone to stop
I've heard them talking
About how I'm gonna put you off

Tell me, how can I put you off
When you're a matter of urgency
I've got a million things that I need to do
But they're all secondary

Make sure you're not followed
And meet me by the death balloon
Paraselene woman
I'm your man in the moon

And like a grain of diamond dust you float
And my devotion's outer crust cracks
