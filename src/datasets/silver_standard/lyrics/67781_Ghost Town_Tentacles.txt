Imagine when your lungs are filling up with liquid
Intoxicated, poison flowing through your veins
It seems like nothing's changed
My purple neck is stating all that I'm against
But I guess that's how we end up when we're underwater

Mayday, Mayday, this ship's going down
And as your captain, I'm ready to drown
I'm gonna drown so deep in you
I'm gonna drown so deep in you

This necklace that you've got wrapped around my neck
Will choke me slowly to my death, and I'm into that

These weights are tied up to my legs
Sinking lifeless has never felt so peaceful
These waves are crashing all the same
Water washing through this sea of people

This necklace that you've got wrapped around my neck
Will choke me slowly to my death, and I'm into that
This necklace that you've got wrapped around my neck
Will choke me slowly to my death, and I'm into that

The purple on my neck stating all that I'm against
This ship is going down, this ship is going down

Mayday, Mayday, this ship's going down
And as your captain, I'm ready to drown
It's been a good run, but we're fucked in this town
Now I'll close my eyes tight 'til we sink to the ground

This necklace that you've got wrapped around my neck
Will choke me slowly to my death, and I'm into that
This necklace that you've got wrapped around my neck
Will choke me slowly to my death, and I'm into that
