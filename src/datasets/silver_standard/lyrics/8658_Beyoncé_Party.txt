Kanye West:
You a bad girl, and your friends bad too, oh;
We got the swag sauce, she drippin' swagu...
You a bad girl, and your friends bad too, oh;

Beyoncé:
I may be young, but I'm ready to give you all my love;
I told my girls you can get it - Don't slow it down, just let it go...

So in love - I'll give it all away;
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow...
So tonight, I'll do it every way;
Speakers knockin' till the morning light, 'cause we like to party...
(I don't know what y'all do,) Ay... (but we likes to party...)
Hey... ay... (We likes to party...)
Hey... (I don't know what y'all do,) ay... (but we likes to party...)
Hey... (Party, party...) 'Cause we like to party!
(I don't know what y'all do,) Ay... (but we likes to party...)
Hey... ay... (We like to party...)
Hey... (I don't know what y'all do,) ay... (but we likes to party...)
Hey... (Party, party...) 'Cause we like to party!

Your touch is driving me crazy - I can't explain the way I feel;
Top down, with the radio on, and the night belongs to us - Just hold me close, don't let me go...

So in love - I don't care what they say!
I don't curr if they talkin' tomorrow...
'Cause tonight's the night, uh-uh-uh-oh, that I give you everything,
Music knockin' till the morning light, 'cause we like to party!

Andre 3000:
Set the scene: 3000 degrees;
I ain't worried 'bout them fuck niggas over there, but they worried 'bout me...
I got a homeboy named Butta and another homeboy, that nigga named Cheese;
Fuck wit' me, baby - I make it milk till it drip down yo' knees...
Spit this shit fo' rillo... brain Brillo;
Kiddo say he looks up to me, this just makes me feel old...
Never thought that we could become someone else's hero;
Man... we were just in the food court, eating our gyros...
Yesterday, that's the way - every single mornin', I try to pray;
Grandmama 'n' nem, they never forgot - nothin' else really mean nothin' to me...
I ain't studyin' the beat... Talkin' to me?
Girl, why you fuckin' wit' me? Move on, ain't nuttin' to see!
Sh... always sung this song - I'm the raw, off the rip;
'Cause of him, all of them, will remember the men,
And that they fell in love with rap - black like havin' your cousin back,
Blue like when that rent is due, cream like when I'm lovin' you, yeah...

Beyoncé:
So in love - I'll give it all away;
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow...
'Cause tonight's the night, uh-uh-uh-oh, that I give you everything,

(I don't know what y'all do,) Ay... (but we likes to party...)
Hey... ay... (We likes to party...)
Hey... (I don't know what y'all do,) ay... (but we likes to party...)
Hey, eh... (Party, party...) 'Cause we like to party!
(I don't know what y'all do,) Ay... (but we likes to party...)
Hey... ay... (We like to party...)
Hey... (I don't know what y'all do,) ay... (but we likes to party...)
Hey... (Party, party...) 'Cause we like to party!
