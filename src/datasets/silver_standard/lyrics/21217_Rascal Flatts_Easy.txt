We broke up
Yeah, it's tough
Most guys would've been crushed
Wastin' their time

Wonderin' where they went wrong
No way, not me
Hey, I'm doing just fine
I'm not afraid to move on

It's easy going out on a Friday night
Easy every time I see her out
I can smile, live it up
The way a single guy does
But what she, what she don't know
Is how hard it is to make it look so
Easy

(Natasha Bedingfield)
The truth is
That I miss lyin' in those arms of his
But I don't ever let it show
I laugh and I act like
I'm having the time of my life
As far as he knows

It's easy goin' out on a Friday night
Easy, every time I see him out
I can smile, live it up
Like a single girl does

But, what he, what he don't know
Is how hard it is to make it look so
Easy
Oh, it's easy

Oh, it's easy goin' out on a Friday night
Oh, it's easy every time I see him out
I can smile, live it up
Forget about the way it was
But what she

Oh, what he don't know
What she don't know
Is how hard it is to make it look so
Easy
Look so easy
