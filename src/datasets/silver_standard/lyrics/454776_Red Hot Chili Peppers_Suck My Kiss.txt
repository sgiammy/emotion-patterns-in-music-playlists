Well, I'm sailing
Yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, oh yeah
Hit me

Should'a been, could'a been, would'a been dead
If I didn't get the message going to my head
I am what I am
Most motherfuckers don't give a damn

Oh baby, think you can?
Be my girl, I'll be your man

Someone full of fun, do me till I'm well done
Little Bo-Peep, coming from my stun gun
Beware, take care
Most motherfuckers have a cold-ass stare

Oh baby, please be there
Suck my kiss, cut me my share

Hit me, you can't hurt me, suck my kiss
Kiss me, please pervert me, stick with this
Is she talking dirty?
Give to me, sweet, sacred bliss
Your mouth was made to suck my kiss

Look at me, can't you see? All I really want to be
Is free from a world that hurts me
I need relief
Do you want me, girl, to be your thief?

Oh baby, just for you
I'd steal anything that you want me to

K-I-S-S-I-N-G
Chicka-chicka dee and do me like a banshee
Lowbrow is how
Swimming in the sound of Bow Wow Wow

Oh baby, do me now
Do me here, I do allow

Hit me, you can't hurt me, suck my kiss
Kiss me, please pervert me, stick with this
Is she gonna curtsy?
Give to me, sweet sacred bliss
That mouth was made to...

Should'a been, could'a been, would'a been dead
If I didn't get the message going to my head
I am what I am
Most motherfuckers don't give a damn

Oh baby, think you can?
Be my girl, I'll be your man

Someone full of fun, do me till I'm well done
Little Bo-Peep, coming from my stun gun
Beware, take care
Most motherfuckers have a cold-ass stare

Oh baby, please be there
Suck my kiss, cut me my share

Hit me, you can't hurt me, suck my kiss
Kiss me, please pervert me, stick with this
Is she talking dirty?
Give to me, sweet, sacred bliss
Your mouth was made to suck my kiss
