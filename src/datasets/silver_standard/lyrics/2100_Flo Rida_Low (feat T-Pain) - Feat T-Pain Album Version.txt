Let me talk to 'em
Let me talk to 'em (let it rain)
Let me talk to 'em
C'mon

Shawty had them Apple Bottom jeans (jeans)
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was looking at her
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reebok's with the straps (with the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (hey)
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

I ain't never seen none that'll make me go
This crazy all night, spending my dough
Had the million dollar vibe and a bottle to go
Them birthday cakes, they stole the show

So sexual, she was flexible
Professional, drinking X&O
Hold up, wait a minute
Do I see what I think I? Whoa

Did I think I've seen shawty get low
Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain I'm making it snow
Work the pole I got the bank roll

I'm a say that I prefer them no clothes
I'm into that, I love women exposed
She threw it back at me I gave her mo'
Cash ain't a problem, I know where it goes

She had them Apple Bottom jeans (jeans)
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was looking at her
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reebok's with the straps (with the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (hey)
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

Hey shawty, what I gotta do to get you home
My jeans filled with gwap and they're ready for show
It's Cadillacs, Maybach for the sexy grown
Patrón on the rocks that'll make you moan

One stack (come on), two stacks (come on), three stacks (come on)
Now that's three grand
What you think I'm playing baby girl I'm the man
I ain't dealing rubber bands

That's what I told her
Her legs on my shoulder
I knew it was over
That Henny and Cola
Got me like a soldier
She ready for rover
I couldn't control her
So lucky on me, I was just like clover

Shawty was hot like a toaster
Sorry but I had to fold her
Like a pornography poster
She showed her

Apple Bottom jeans (jeans)
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was looking at her
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reebok's with the straps (with the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (hey)
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

Whoa shawty, yeah she was worth the money
Lil' mama took my cash
And I ain't want it back
The way she bent that back
Got all them paper stacks
Tattoo above her crack
I had to handle that

I was on it sexy woman
Let me show it, made me want it
Two in the morning, I'm zoned in
Them rosé bottles foaming

She wouldn't stop, made it drop
Shawty did that pop & lock
Had to break her off that gwap
Gal was fine, just like my glock

Apple Bottom jeans (jeans)
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was looking at her
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reebok's with the straps (with the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (hey)
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

Come on
