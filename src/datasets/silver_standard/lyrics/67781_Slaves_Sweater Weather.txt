All I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach
But I stand in California
With my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves on my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck, I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts

Oh
She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing I really wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold
For you here
And now
So let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides your mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to race
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watched your face
Put my finger on your tongue
Cause you love to taste yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for

Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour
Coming down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing I really want to tell you about
No no

'Cause it's too cold
For you here
And now
So let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

'Cause it's too cold
For you here
And now
So let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

'Cause it's too cold
For you here
And now
So let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

'Cause it's too cold
For you here
And now
So let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
