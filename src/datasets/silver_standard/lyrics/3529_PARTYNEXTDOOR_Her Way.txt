Yeah I see her, PX

Swear I'm gone, gettin' gone with my niggas
We hit the club, niggas cups full of jealous
We in the back and we muggin' to T.I. (you know it)
And I'm with a bad bitch and I got an idea (oh yeah)

(I'll still say) This bitch looks like Lindsay Lohan
She gets down just like Lindsay Lohan
Round the block, she's not showin' nothin'
That bitch bad, watch her blow a whole band

She gets her way (way, way, way)
It's like every time
Like any time of day
In every single way
Girl when she gets her way (way, way, way)
That's just how she ball
That's just how she hustles
No clue how she does it
She gets her way, way

Shawty said she wanna roll with the Sauga City come up
She wasn't on a roll, now she roll with a winner (rollin' marijuana)
See them dark-skin girls in them light-skin crews
Yah, we see you
But she the light-skin girl in a light-skin crew
She don't know what to do

(I'll still say) This bitch looks like Lindsay Lohan
She gets down just like Lindsay Lohan
Round the block, she's not showin' nothin'
That bitch bad, watch her blow a whole band

She gets her way (way, way, way)
It's like every time
Like any time of day
In every single way
Girl when she gets her way (way, way, way)
That's just how she ball
That's just how she hustles
No clue how she does it
She gets her way, way

She just turned twenty-five
But she wanna roll with young niggas like
Roll with the clique, oh, roll with the clique
Now she say
Gone, gettin' gone with them niggas
Swear I just saw her say
We in the back and we muggin' to T.I
Swear I just saw her say
Gone, gettin' gone with them niggas
If this what she want to be
Then she can have her way
Oh no no no
Yeah yeah
No baby
You could have your way
No no

She gets her way (way, way, way)
It's like every time
Like any time of day
In every single way
Girl when she gets her way (way, way, way)
That's just how she ball
That's just how she hustles
No clue how she does it
She gets her way, way
