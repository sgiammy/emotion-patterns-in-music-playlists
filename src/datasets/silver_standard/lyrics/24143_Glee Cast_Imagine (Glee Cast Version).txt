Mercedes:
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothin' to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people
Livin' life in peace
Yoo-hoo-ooh

Artie & Mercedes:
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you will join us
And the world will be as one

Rachel & Finn:
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man

New Directions!:
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world
Yoo-hoo-ooh

Mercedes:
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you will join us
And the world will live as one
