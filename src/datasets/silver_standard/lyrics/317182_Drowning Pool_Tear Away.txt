I'm tearing away - Pieces are falling
I can't seem to make them stay...
You run away - Faster and faster
You can't seem to get away... Break

Hope there's a reason, for questions unanswered
I just don't see everything...
Yes, I'm inside you
Tell me how does it feel to feel like this, just like I do?

I don't care about anyone else but me
I don't care about anyone
I don't care about anyone else but me
I don't care about anyone

Do I really want this?
Sometimes I scare myself, I just can't let it go
Can you believe it?
Everything happens for reasons I just don't know

I don't care about anyone else but me
I don't care about anyone
I don't care about anyone else but me
I don't care about anyone or anything, but me
...("Goddamn, I love me")

I don't care about anyone else but me
I don't care about anyone
I don't care about anyone else but me
I don't care about anyone or anything...
...(Softly):
I don't care about anyone else but me
I don't care about anyone
