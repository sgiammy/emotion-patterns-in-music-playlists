I'm nice right now, man
I, I feel good
If you have a drink
Would you please put it in the air?

That party last night was awfully crazy
I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off
And had this one girl completely naked

Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at 3, wake up at 10
Go out to eat, then do it again
Man, I love college

I wanna go to college for the rest of my life
Sip Bankers Club and drink Miller Lite
On thirsty Thursday and Tuesday night ice
And I can get pizza a dollar a slice

So fill up my cup, lets get fucked up
I'm next on the table, who want what?
I am champion at beer pong
Allen Iverson, Hakeem Olajuwon

Don't even bounce, not in my house
Better hope you make it, otherwise you naked
Time isn't wasted when you're getting wasted
Woke up today and all I could say is, um…

That party last night was awfully crazy
I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off
And had this one girl completely naked

Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at 3, wake up at 10
Go out to eat, then do it again

Man, I love college (Ay!)
I love drinkin' (Ay!)
I love women (Ay!)
Man, I love college

I can't tell you what I learned from school
But I could tell you a story or two
Um, yeah of course I learned some rules
Like don't pass out with your shoes on

And don't leave the house till the booze gone
And don't have sex if she's too gone
When it comes to condoms, put two on
Then tomorrow night, find a new joint

Hold the beer bong, nothing wrong with some fun
Even if we did get a little bit too drunk
Time isn't wasted when you're getting wasted
Woke up today and all I could say is

That party last night was awfully crazy
I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off
And had this one girl completely naked

Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at 3, wake up at 10
Go out to eat, then do it again

Man, I love college (Ay!)
I love drinkin' (Ay!)
I love women (Ay!)
I love college

Now, if everybody would please
Put their drink as high as they can
As high as they can
And repeat after me

Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug

Freshmen
(Freshmen, freshmen, freshmen)

Do something crazy
(Do something crazy, do something crazy, do something crazy)

Keg stand
(Keg stand, keg stand, keg stand)

That party last night
Man, I love college… I love it
That party last night
A'ight everybody, I gotta head back to class for a little bit

That party last night was awfully crazy
I wish we taped it (You know whats goin down)
I danced my ass off
And had this one girl completely naked

Drink my beer and smoke my weed (You're all invited)
But my good friends is all I need (Bring your friends)
Pass out at 3, wake up at 10
Go out to eat, then do it again
Man, I love college

Do I really have to graduate, or can I just stay here the rest of my life?
