I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
I ain't wearin' na-nada
I'm sitting pretty, impatient
But I know you gotta
Put in them hours
I'mma make it harder
I'm sendin' pic after picture
I'mma get you fired

I know you're always on that night shift
But I can't stand these nights alone
And I don't need no explanation
'Cause baby you're the boss at home

You don't gotta go to work, work, work, work, work, work, work
But you gotta put in work, work, work, work, work, work, work
You don't gotta go to work, work, work, work, work, work, work
Let my body do the work, work, work, work, work, work, work
We can work from home, oh oh oh oh oh
We can work from home, oh oh oh oh oh

Let's put it into motion
I'mma give you a promotion
I'll make it feel like a vacay
Turn the bed into an ocean
We don't need nobody
I just need your body
Nothin' but sheets in between us
Ain't no gettin' off early

I know you're always on that night shift
But I can't stand these nights alone
And I don't need no explanation
'Cause baby you're the boss at home

You don't gotta go to work, work, work, work, work, work, work
But you gotta put in work, work, work, work, work, work, work
You don't gotta go to work, work, work, work, work, work, work
Let my body do the work, work, work, work, work, work, work
We can work from home, oh oh oh oh oh
We can work from home, oh oh oh oh oh

Oh, yeah
Girl gotta work for me
Can you make it clap?
No hands for me
Take it to the ground
Pick it up for me
Look back at it
All on for me
Put in work like my timesheet
She ride it like a '63
I'mma buy her no Celine
Let her ride in a foreign with me
Oh, she the bae, I'm her boo
And she down to break the rules
Ride or die, she gon' go
I won't judge, she finesse
I pipe her, she take that
Puttin' overtime on your body

You ain't gotta go to work, no

You don't gotta go to work, work, work, work, work, work, work
But you gotta put in work, work, work, work, work, work, work
You don't gotta go to work, work, work, work, work, work, work
Let my body do the work, work, work, work, work, work, work

Do the work, do the work, yeah yeah
We can work from home, oh oh oh oh oh
We can work from home, oh oh oh oh oh
Yeah, we can work from home, oh oh yeah
We can work from home, oh oh yeah
