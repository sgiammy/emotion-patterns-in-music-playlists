Now it's day, I've been trying to get that taste off my tongue
I was dreaming of just you, now our cereal, it is warm
Attractive day in the rubble of the night from before
Now I can't walk in a vacuum, I feel ugly, feel my pores
It's the trees of this day that I do battle with for the light
Then I start to feel trapped in, people greet me, I'm polite
"What's the day? What's you doing? How's your mood? How's that song?"
Man it passes right by me, it's behind me, now it's gone

And I can't lift you up 'cause my mind is tired
It's family beaches that I desire
A sacred night, where we'll watch the fireworks
The frightened babies poo
They've got two flashing eyes and they're colored why
They make me feel that I'm only all I see sometimes

I was eating with a good friend
Who said "A Genii made me out of the earth's skin"
But in spite of her she is my birth kin
She spits me out in her surly blood rivers
All the people life lurking in dominions of a hot Turk dish
If the elephants are reaching for our purses
Then meet me after the world with the shivers
I was eating with a good friend
Who said "A Genii made me out of the earth's skin"
But in spite of her she is my birth kin
She spits me out in her surly blood rivers
All the people life lurking in dominions of a hot Turk dish
If the elephants are reaching for our purses
Then meet me after the world with the shivers

If the elephants are reaching for our purses
Then meet me after the world with the shivers
"What's the day? What's you doing? How's your food? How's that song?"
Man it passes right by me, it's behind me, now it's gone

And I can't lift you up 'cause my mind is tired
It's family beaches that I desire
That sacred night where we watched the fireworks
They frightened the babies and you know they've got two
Flashing eyes and if they are color blind
They make me feel that you're only what I see sometimes
And I can't lift you up 'cause my mind is tired
It's family beaches that I desire
That sacred night where we watched the fireworks
They frightened the babies and you know they've got two
Flashing eyes and if they are color blind
