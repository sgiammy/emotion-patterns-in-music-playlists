I secretly crave, crave that scent again
Still feel it pressing on me now
Now with the onset, my flesh is weakening
I steel my nerves for temptations at hand again

And I hear this calling
Still, you don't seem so far at all
And I hear this calling out

No secrets, deception for these would tear this down
I'll note the past; spare the pain
Words match my deeds with brutal honesty 
Never forget these choices were made by me

And I hear this calling
Still, you don't seem so far at all
And I hear this calling
Still, you don't seem so far at all
And I hear this calling out

Not falling victim to the fire that burns inside of me
Though I am fearful I will not prevent this tragedy 
My strengths been tested; I wear the scars that prove 
Still, I believe that this calling will see me through

And I hear this calling
Still, you don't seem so far at all
And I hear this calling
Still, you don't seem so far at all
And I hear this calling out

My strength's been tested; I wear the scars that prove
Still, I believe that this calling will see me through
Still, I believe this calling will see me through
