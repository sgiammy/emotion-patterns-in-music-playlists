"Superstition, fear, and jealousy."

Dead I am the one
Exterminating son
Slipping through the trees
Strangling the breeze

Dead I am the sky
Watching angels cry
While they slowly turn
Conquering the worm

Dig through the ditches and burn through the witches
I slam in the back of my Dragula
Dig through the ditches and burn through the witches
I slam in the back of my Dragula

Dead I am the pool
Spreading from the fool
Weak and want you need
Nowhere as you bleed

Dead I am the rat 
Feast upon the cat 
Tender is the fur 
Dying as you purr 

Dig through the ditches and burn through the witches
I slam in the back of my Dragula
Dig through the ditches and burn through the witches
I slam in the back of my Dragula

Do it baby, do it baby
Do it baby, do it baby
Burn like an animal

Dead I am the light
Dig into the skin
Knuckle crack the bone
Twenty-one to win

Dead I am the dog
Hound of hell you cry
Devil on your back
I can never die

Dig through the ditches and burn through the witches
I slam in the back of my Dragula
Dig through the ditches and burn through the witches
I slam in the back of my Dragula

Do it baby, do it baby
Do it baby, do it baby
Burn like an animal

Dig through the ditches and burn through the witches
I slam in the back of my Dragula
Dig through the ditches and burn through the witches
I slam in the back of my Dragula

Dig through the ditches and burn through the witches
I slam in the back of my Dragula
