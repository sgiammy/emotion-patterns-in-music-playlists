Oh yeah
I'm not always there when you call (Buckshots, hah), but I'm always on time
Gave you my all, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my all, baby

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine

C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other (shit)
I know I got a lot of things I need to explain
But baby, you know the game and love is about pain

So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game so bat me down in the paint
'Cause I can't wait no more
'Cause it's about a quarter-past three and shorty's eyein' me

I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I love to see that ass in Gucci shades
Hold down on the bed while I'm yankin' your braids

Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smackin' your ass and fuckin' you all wild
But we share somethin' so rare
But who cares, you care 

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine

Girl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together
It's only a sunshower, we been through worse weather
Like the stormy nights you wrote a "Dear Ja" letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather

Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B
Money Over Bitches, Murder, I-N-C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy

I'm a playground legend like Kirk with Pee-Wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered

Truth or dare, this life ain't apparently fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share somethin' so rare
But who cares, you care

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine

Oh I'm feelin' like ya livin' a double life
'Cause you don't be comin' home sometimes
Baby, but you're always, on time 
Checkin' for one time

You and I got a special bond together
We go back like bombers, boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play you play the same way you freak me, baby
I fuck you crazy, then I'm gone

Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious

And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
But who cares, you care

Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby be mine

Always there when you call, I'm always on time
Gave you my all, baby be mine
Always there when you call,  I'm always on time
Gave you my all, baby, be mine

Here at W-I and Z we play nuthin' but da hits
Nuthin' but da hits
Nuthin' but da motha fuckin hits...
