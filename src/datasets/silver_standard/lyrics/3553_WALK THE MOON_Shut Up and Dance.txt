"Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me"
I said, "You're holding back"
She said, "Shut up and dance with me"
This woman is my destiny
She said, "Ooh hoo
Shut up and dance with me"

We were victims of the night
The chemical, physical kryptonite
Helpless to the bass and the fading light
Oh, we were bound to get together
Bound to get together

She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor, and she said

"Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me"
I said, "You're holding back"
She said, "Shut up and dance with me"
This woman is my destiny
She said, "Ooh hoo
Shut up and dance with me"

A backless dress and some beat up sneaks
My discoth√®que Juliet, teenage dream
I felt it in my chest as she looked at me
I knew we were bound to be together
Bound to be together

She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor, and she said

"Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me"
I said, "You're holding back"
She said, "Shut up and dance with me"
This woman is my destiny
She said, "Ooh hoo
Shut up and dance with me"

Oh, c'mon girl!

Deep in her eyes
I think I see the future
I realize this is my last chance
She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor, and she said

"Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me"
I said, "You're holding back"
She said, "Shut up and dance with me"
This woman is my destiny
She said, "Ooh hoo
Shut up and dance"

"Don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me"
I said, "You're holding back"
She said, "Shut up and dance with me"
This woman is my destiny
She said, "Ooh hoo
Shut up and dance with me"

Ooh hoo
Shut up and dance with me
Ooh hoo
Shut up and dance with me
