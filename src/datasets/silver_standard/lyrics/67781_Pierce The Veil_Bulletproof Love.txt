I breathe you in with smoke in the backyard lights.
We used to laugh until we choked into the wasted nights.
It was the best time of my life, but now I sleep alone.
So don't don't wake me up, because my thrill is gone.(say I'm wrong)
In the sunset turning red behind the smoke.
Forever and alone.
Yeah.

You've gone and sewn me to this bed, the taste of you and me
Will never leave my lips again, under the blinding rain.
I wanna hold your hand so tight, I'm gonna break my wrist,
And when the vultures sing tonight, I'm gonna join right in.

I'll sing along,
'Cause I don't know any other song
I'll sing along, but I'm barely hanging on.
No, I'm barely hanging on.
By the time you're hearing this I'll already be gone.
And now there's nothing to do, but scream at the drunken moon

This isn't fair, no, don't you try to blame this on me.
My love for you was bulletproof, but your the one who shot me.
And goddamn it, I can barely say your name.
So I'll try to write it and fill the pen with blood from the sink.
Whoa. Oh.
But, don't just say it, you should sing my name.
Pretend that it's a song 'cause forever it's yours.
And we can sing this on the way home.

I'll sing along,
'Cause I don't know any other song
I'll sing along, but I'm barely hanging on.
No, I'm barely hanging on.
By the time you're hearing this I'll already be gone.
But there's nothing to do, but tear my lies apart.
There's nothing to do but tear my voice apart
(Nothing to do) and scream at the drunken moon
