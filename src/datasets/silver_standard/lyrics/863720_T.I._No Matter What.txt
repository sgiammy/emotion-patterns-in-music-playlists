I say, still I stand
Hey shorty here I am

Never have ya seen in ya lifetime
A more divine Southern rapper with a swagga like mine
Facin' all kind of time, but smile like I'm fine
Brag with such passion and shine without tryin'
Believe me, pain's a small thing to a giant
I was born without a dime, out the gutter I climbed
Spoke my mind and didn't stutter one time
Ali say even the greatest gotta suffer sometime
So I huff and puff rhymes, lyrics so sick wit' it
Set the standard in Atlanta, how to get get get it
So you up-and-coming rappers wanna diss, just kill it
I'm officially the realest, point blank, period
Whether I still live in the hood or just visit
Whatever you can do in the hood, I done did it
That why the dope boys and the misfits feel it
This still the city long as Tip livin,' nigga

I ain't dead (Nah), I ain't done (Nah)
I ain't scared (Of what?), I ain't run (From who?)
But still I stand (Yeah)
No matter what, people, here I am (Yeah)
No matter what, remember
I ain't break (Never), I ain't fold (Never)
They hate me more (So?), and yeah, I know (Ha ha)
But here I go (Yeah)
No matter what, shorty, here I go (Ha)
No matter what, shorty

You let the blog sites and the magazines tell it
I'm sure to be in jail till 2027
Rather see me in the cell than instead of this new McLaren
God will take you to hell just to get you to heaven
So even though it's heavy, the load I will carry
Grin is still bear it, win and still share it
Apologies to the fans, I hope you can understand it
Life can change your directions, even when ye ain't planned it
All you can do it handle it, worst thing you can do is panic
Use it to your advantage, avoid insanity, manage
To conquer every obstacle, make impossible possible
Even when winning's illogical, losing's still far from optional
Ay, yeah they wanna see you shot up in the hospital
But when life throw punches, block and counter like a boxer do
Been locked inside mi casa too long, I did a song
To make it known that the King lives on, pimpin'

I ain't dead (Nah), I ain't done (Nah)
I ain't scared (Of what?), I ain't run (From who?)
But still I stand (Yeah)
No matter what, people, here I am (Yeah)
No matter what, remember
I ain't break (Never), I ain't fold (Never)
They hate me more (So?), and yeah, I know (Ha ha)
But here I go (Yeah)
No matter what, shorty, here I go (Ha)
No matter what, shorty

Even in solitude, there's still no hotter dude
I show you how to do what you do, ya ain't got a clue
All you do is follow dudes, sound like a lotta dudes
I'll weather whatever storm, make it out without a bruise
I understand why, now when my hands tied
They take shots 'cause if I'm out there, it's a landslide
But revenge is best served as a cold dish
And suckas will get served, nigga,
Guess it was understood, for me it was over with
But I don't quit, if ye ain't noticed yet
They couldn't wait to say goodnight, shorty
So they can try to rhyme, act and look like shorty
Go get a beat from Toomp and make a hook like shorty
'Fore you know it I'm back, what it look like, shorty?
I lost my partner and my daughter in the same year
Somehow I rise above my problems and remain here
Yeah, and I hope the picture painted clear
If your heart filled with faith then you can't fear
Wonder how I face years and I'm still chillin'?
Easy, let go and let God deal with it

I ain't dead (Nah), I ain't done (Nah)
I ain't scared (Of what?), I ain't run (From who?)
But still I stand (Yeah)
No matter what, people, here I am (Yeah)
No matter what, remember
I ain't break (Never), I ain't fold (Never)
They hate me more (So?), and yeah, I know (Ha ha)
But here I go (Yeah)
No matter what, shorty, here I go (Ha)
No matter what, shorty
