I know I can't take one more step towards you
'Cause all that's waiting is regret
And don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore
You lost the love I loved the most

I learned to live half-alive
And now you want me one more time

And who do you think you are, running 'round leaving scars?
Collecting your jar of hearts and tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me, who do you think you are?

I hear you're asking all around
If I am anywhere to be found
But I have grown too strong
To ever fall back in your arms

I learned to live half-alive
And now you want me one more time

And who do you think you are, running 'round leaving scars?
Collecting your jar of hearts, tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me, who do you think you are?

It took so long just to feel alright
Remember how to put back the light in my eyes
I wish I had missed the first time that we kissed
'Cause you broke all your promises

And now you're back, you don't get to get me back

And who do you think you are, running 'round leaving scars?
Collecting your jar of hearts and tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul
So don't come back for me, don't come back at all

And who do you think you are, running 'round leaving scars?
Collecting your jar of hearts, tearing love apart
You're gonna catch a cold from the ice inside your soul
Don't come back to me, don't come back at all

Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
Who do you think you are?
