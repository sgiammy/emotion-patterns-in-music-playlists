Looks like I'mma do everything myself
Maybe I could use some help, but, hell, if ya want somethin' done right
You gotta do it yourself

Maybe life is up and down, but my life's been what till now?
I crawled up your butt somehow, and that's when things got turned around

I used to be alive, now I feel pathetic
And now I get it, what's done is done
You just leave it alone and don't regret it

Sometimes, some things turn into dumb things
And that's when you put your foot down

Why did I have to go meet somebody like you?
(Like you)
Why did you have to go hurt somebody like me?
(Like me)
How could you do somebody like that?
(Like that)
Hope you know that I'm never coming back
(Never coming back)

Depending on you is done, giving to you is done
No more eating, no sleeping, no living
It's all just more giving to you and I'm done

Depending on you is done, giving to you is done
No more eating, no sleeping, no living
It's all just more giving to you and I'm done

The hiding from you is done, the lying from you is done
No more eating, no sleeping, no living
It's all just more giving to you and I'm done
