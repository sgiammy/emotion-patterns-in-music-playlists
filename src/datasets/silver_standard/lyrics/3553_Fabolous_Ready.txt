And baby we don't need a bed, no
Don't need a master room, don't need to set the mood
She like, "Yeah, yeah"
One touch one touch, she gon' give me all the love
She's ready, so ready
She ready, so I'm ready
I feel it comin' on strong, you're so heavy
She ready, I'm ready

I hear if you stay ready, you ain't gotta get ready
Call you when I get there, you just get your shit wetty
Oops I mean your shit ready, can't believe I said that
Least you know where my head at, now shorty where your head at
She gon' dive in head first, school me like the board of ed
She do it then we do it so she can say she thought ahead
Laid up in that all day, can't get out that waterbed
Talk nasty for ya boy, silent treatment for the feds
No cup for the thirsty, she bad as controversy
Skin-tone like Hershey, body Lord have mercy
Yeah if this thing were a car, it'd be a Lamborghini Mercy
Maybe I'm too fast, girl say she

And baby we don't need a bed, no
Don't need a master room, don't need to set the mood
She like, "Yeah, yeah"
One touch one touch, she gon' give me all the love
She's ready, so ready
She ready, so I'm ready
I feel it comin' on strong, you're so heavy
She ready, I'm ready

Talkin' 'bout you born ready, talkin' 'bout it's on deck
Talk a good one on text, you say you 'bout it I'm gon' check
I put some kisses on neck, let me warm that engine up
Relax when the tension's up, girl you just call your nigga up
And I pop up in that all black and kill that
See I'm dressed appropriate, you got to feel that
Feel that? (I feel that)
That's that love comin' down
For the brain, I'm dumbin' down, we on swole when she come around
Need ice to numb it down, night stick to beat it up
Rodney King that teen girl, can't we all just get along?
You could get along, you already know, but is you ready though?

And baby we don't need a bed, no
Don't need a master room, don't need to set the mood
She like, "Yeah, yeah"
One touch one touch, she gon' give me all the love
She's ready, so ready
She ready, so I'm ready
I feel it comin' on strong, you're so heavy
She ready, I'm ready

If you are a bad one, be ready (Be ready)
Two times for my niggas, we ready (We so ready)
Three ladies in the V.I. and they ready (They so ready)
I'm feelin' good, chillin' good, I'm ready (I'm ready, yo)
Left a girl in the back, she ready (She so ready)
We don't know how to act, we ready ('Cause we're ready)
And we can't wait to get home (If you're ready, come on)

And baby we don't need a bed, no
Don't need a master room, don't need to set the mood
She like, "Yeah, yeah"
One touch one touch, she gon' give me all the love
She's ready, so ready
She ready, so I'm ready
I feel it comin' on strong, you're so heavy
She ready, I'm ready
