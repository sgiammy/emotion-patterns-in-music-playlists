You see I've got this American love
A brand new planet in the solar system
I'll kiss your neck
But I just can't look her in the eye
You leave for college
At the turn of autumn
I spent the winter
Diving to the bottom
I'll kiss your neck
But I just can't look you in the eye

Big hearts are for breaking

You see I've got this critical conscience
A brand new black hole in the solar system
I'll dig my grave but I just can't stand to step inside
And when they find out
They'll sound every siren
Break the door down
To find a baby crying
You thought I knew it's just not right to tell a lie

Big hearts are for breaking

Now there's no turning back
In the face of the sweat we shared
There's nowhere to run
We are so unprepared
It's a new heart attack
Brand new bricks on my back to bear
But don't say a word or they might find us there

You see I've got this American love
A hidden planet in the solar system
But keep your eyes shut
I just can't stand to say goodbye

Big hearts are for breaking
