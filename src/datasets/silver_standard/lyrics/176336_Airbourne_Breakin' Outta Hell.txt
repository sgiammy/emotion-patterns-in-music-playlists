I'm gonna hit the highway and I never look back
'Cause you're just a memory I wish I never had
When the walls close in it the time to get out
Don't matter what's in front of me, I'll find a way round

It don't matter no more
I got my foot to the floor
Like a bullet from a gun
I was born to run

I'm breakin' outta hell, breakin' outta hell
I'm breakin' outta hell, breakin' outta hell
Breakin' out, breakin' out, breakin' out
Breakin' outta hell
Breakin' out, breakin' out, breakin' out
Breakin' outta hell

I ain't got nothing to lose 'cause I don't have nothin'
Until I get where I'm going I'm gonna keep runnin'
I might be insane, but I sure ain't scared
'Cause I'm a crazy motherfucker and I just don't care

It don't matter no more
I got my foot to the floor
Like a bullet from a gun
I was born to run

I'm breakin' outta hell, breakin' outta hell
I'm breakin' outta hell, breakin' outta hell
I'm breakin' outta hell, breakin' outta hell
I'm breakin' outta hell, breakin' outta hell
Breakin' out, breakin' out, breakin' out
Breakin' outta hell
Breakin' out, breakin' out, breakin' out
Breakin' outta hell

'Cause I'm breakin' outta hell, breakin' outta hell
I'm breakin' outta hell, breakin' outta hell
Breakin' outta hell, breakin' outta hell
I'm breakin' outta hell, breakin' outta hell
'Cause I'm breakin', breakin' outta hell
Breakin'
Breakin'
Out of hell
