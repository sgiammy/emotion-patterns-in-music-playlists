Standing beside myself in disbelief and I stop to imagine this life underneath it all new to the reason this consequence brings I'm not calm I'm not honest you're not who I thought you'd be

Lie
You'll always be with me a lie
Lie
You'll never forget me a lie
Lie
Stay safe the truth is that I
Never made you feel alive

Into the window you locked up I climb and I stop to examine the love in our live it's all new to me and we are crossing the lines I'm not cold but it's clear to me you're not who I thought you'd be

No... No you're not
No... Never made you feel alive

Lie
You'll always be with me a lie

Lie
You'll never forget me a lie
Lie
Stay safe the truth is that I
Never made you feel alive

I'm not, you're not, we're not coming through
I'm not, you're not, we're not coming through
I'm not, you're not, we're not coming through

Standing beside myself in disbelief and I stop to imagine this life underneath it all new to the reason this consequence brings I'm not calm I'm not honest you're not who I thought you'd be
You're not who I thought you'd be
You're not who I thought you'd be
You're not who I thought you'd be
