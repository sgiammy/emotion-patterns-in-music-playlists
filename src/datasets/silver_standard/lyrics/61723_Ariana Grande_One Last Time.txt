I was a liar, I gave into the fire;
I know I should've fought it - at least I'm being honest...
Feel like a failure, 'cause I know that I failed you;
I should've done you better, 'cause you don't want a liar...

And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything, but boy, I couldn't give it to you;
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything, but I got nothing here without you...

So one last time, I need to be the one who takes you home;
One more time - I promise after that, I'll let you go...
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart;
All I really care is you wake up in my arms...
One last time, I need to be the one who takes you home...

I don't deserve it, I know I don't deserve it,
But stay with me a minute, I'll swear I'll make it worth it...
Can't you forgive me at least just temporarily?
I know that this is my fault, I should have been more careful...

And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything, but boy, I couldn't give it to you;
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything, but I got nothing here without you, baby...

So one last time, I need to be the one who takes you home;
One more time - I promise after that, I'll let you go...
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart;
All I really care is you wake up in my arms...
One last time, I need to be the one who takes you home...

I know I should've fought it, at least I'm being honest, yeah-ee;
Just stay with me a minute, I swear I'll make it worth it, babe,
'Cause I don't want to be without you...

So one last time, I need to be the one who takes you home; (Takes you home, boy...)
One more time - I promise after that, I'll let you go... (I promise that... let you go...)
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart; 
All I really care is you wake up in my arms... (Wake up in my arms...)
One last time, I need to be the one who takes you home...

One last time, I need to be the one who takes you home...
