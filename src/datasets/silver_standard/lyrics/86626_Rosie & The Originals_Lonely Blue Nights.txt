Whooo hoo whoo hoo
Whooo hoo whoo hoo

Lonelier night's loney loney blues
I can't hold you tight I've got nothing
To lose but since you been gone all
I have is lonely blue hoo hoo hoo hoo

My night are filled with tears my
Heart is filled with pain I promise
I'll be true if you just come back
Again for since you been away all
I have is lonely blue hoo...

I'm sorry I hurt you darling I'll
Prove it to you someday regreting
The things I've said that made
You go away and know your faraway
You might hear my cry and come
Home someday for ever to be mine

Sorry I hurt you darling I'll prove
It to you someday regreting the
Things I've said dear that made
You go away but since be been
Away all I have is lonely blues
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo's whoo hoo
Whooo hoo hoo hoo...
