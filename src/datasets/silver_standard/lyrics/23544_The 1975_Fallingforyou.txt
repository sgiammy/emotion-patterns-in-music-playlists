What time you coming out?
We started losing light
I'll never make it right if you don't want me round
I'm so excited for the night
All we need's my bike and your enormous house
You said some day we might
When I'm closer to your height
Till then we'll knock around, and I'll see
If you're all I need

Don't you see me?
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
And don't you need me?
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
And on this night and in this light
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
Maybe you'll change your mind
I think I'm falling, I think I'm falling

I'm caught on your coat again
You said, 'Oh, no, it's fine'
I read between the lines
And touch your leg again
I'll take you one day at a time
Soon you will be mine
Oh but I want you now
When the smoke is in your eyes
You look so alive
Do you fancy sitting down with me, maybe?
If you're all I need

According to your heart
My place is not deliberate
The feeling of your arms
I don't wanna be your friend
I wanna kiss your neck

Don't you see me?
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
And don't you need me?
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
And on this night and in this light
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
Maybe you'll change your mind
