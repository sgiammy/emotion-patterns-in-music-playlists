Dreams, that's where I have to go
To see your beautiful face anymore
I stare at a picture of you
And listen to the radio

Hope, hope there's a conversation
We both admit we had it good
But until then it's alienation
I know that much is understood

And I realize
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind

But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you
Not over you

Damn, damn girl, you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell
But still you're magnificent

I, I'm a boomerang
Doesn't matter how you throw me
Turn around and I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me
But I'm not even close without you

If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind

But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you

And if I had the chance to renew
You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do
I could get back on the right track
But only if you'd be convinced

So until then
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind

But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you

Not over you
Not over you
Not over you
