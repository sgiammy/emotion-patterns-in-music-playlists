Chest to chest
Nose to nose
Palm to palm
We were always just that close

Wrist to wrist
Toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose
So how come when I reach out my fingers
It feels like more than distance between us

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I'll be California wishing on these stars
Warmed your heart for me
My California king

Eye to eye
Cheek to cheek
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me

Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets
So how come when I reach out my fingers
It feels like more than distance between us

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I'll be California wishing on these stars
Warmed your heart for me
My California king

Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then my eyes got wetter

So confused wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna feel so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming, hey, hey, hey, hey

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart, art, art, art
It's California wishing on these stars
Warmed your heart for me
My California king

My California king

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I'll be California wishing on these stars
Warmed your heart for me
My California king
