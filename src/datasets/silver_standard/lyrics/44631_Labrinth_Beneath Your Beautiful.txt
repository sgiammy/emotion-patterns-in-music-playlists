You tell all the boys no
Makes you feel good, yeah
I know you're out of my league
But that won't scare me away, oh no

You've carried on so long
You couldn't stop if you tried it
You've built your wall so high
That no one could climb it
But I'm gonna try

Would you let me see beneath your beautiful?
Would you let me see beneath your perfect?
Take it off now girl, take it off now girl
I wanna see inside
Would you let me see beneath your beautiful tonight?

You let all the girls go
Makes you feel good, don't it?
Behind your Broadway show
I heard a voice say "Please don't hurt me"

You've carried on so long
You couldn't stop if you tried it
You've built your wall so high
That no one could climb it
But I'm gonna try

Would you let me see beneath your beautiful?
Would you let me see beneath your perfect?
Take it off now boy, take it off now boy
I wanna see inside
Would you let me see beneath your beautiful tonight?
Oh, tonight

See beneath, see beneath


I

Tonight

I

I'm gonna climb on top your ivory tower
I'll hold your hand and then we'll jump right out

We'll be falling, falling
But that's okay
'Cause I'll be right here
I just wanna know

Would you let me see beneath your beautiful?
Would you let me see beneath your perfect?
Take it off now girl, take it off now girl
'Cause I wanna see inside

Would you let me see beneath your beautiful tonight?
Tonight, see beneath your beautiful
Oh tonight, we ain't perfect, we ain't perfect
Would you let me see beneath your beautiful tonight?
