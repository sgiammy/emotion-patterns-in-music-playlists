Don't be so quick to walk away (dance with me)
I wanna rock your body, please stay (dance with me)
You don't have to admit you wanna play (dance with me)
Let me rock you till the break of day (dance with me)

Got time, but I don't mind
Just wanna rock you, girl
I'll have whatever you have
Come on, let's give it a whirl
See, I've been watching you
And I like the way you move
So go ahead, girl, just do
That ass shaking thing you do

So you grab your girls, and you grab a couple more
And you all can meet me in the middle of the floor
Said the air is thick, it's smelling right
So you pass to the left, then you sail to the right

Don't be so quick to walk away (dance with me)
I wanna rock your body, please stay (dance with me)
You don't have to admit you wanna play (dance with me)
Let me rock you till the break of day (dance with me)

I don't mean no harm
Just wanna rock you girl
You can move, but be calm
Let's go, let's give it a whirl
See it appears to me
You like the way I move
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
Pull you close and share my groove

So you grab your girls, and you grab a couple more
And you all can meet me in the middle of the floor
Said the air is thick, it's smelling right
So you pass to the left, then you sail to the right

Don't be so quick to walk away (dance with me)
I wanna rock your body, please stay (dance with me)
You don't have to admit you wanna play (dance with me)
Let me rock you till the break of day (dance with me)

(Talk to me, boy) No disrespect, I don't mean no harm
(Talk to me, boy) But I can't wait to have you in my arms
(Talk to me, boy) Hurry up 'cause you're taking too long
(Talk to me, boy) Bet I have you naked by the end of this song

So why did you come here for (I've came to dance with you)
Baby you don't wanna hit the floor (Need to romance with you)
You're searching for love forevermore (And I'll take a chance)
If love is here on the floor, girl

Hey, dance with me
Yeah
Come on, baby

(Don't be so quick to) Don't walk away, come on and dance with me
(I wanna rock your body) Let me rock your body
(Please stay) Come on and dance with me
(You don't have to admit you wanna play)
You don't have to admit you wanna play, just dance with me
(Just let me rock you) Do, do, do-do
(Till the break of day) Come on and dance with me

(Talk to me, boy) No disrespect, I don't mean no harm
(Talk to me, boy) But I can't wait to have you in my arms
(Talk to me, boy) Hurry up 'cause you're taking too long
(Talk to me, boy) Bet I have you naked by the end of this song

(Don't be so quick to walk away) I'm just thinking of you
(Don't be so quick to walk away) We could do something
(Don't be so quick to walk away) I like the way you look right now
(Don't be so quick to walk away) Come over here, baby

Are you feeling me
Let's do something
Let's make a bet
'Cause I
I bet I have you naked by the end of this song
