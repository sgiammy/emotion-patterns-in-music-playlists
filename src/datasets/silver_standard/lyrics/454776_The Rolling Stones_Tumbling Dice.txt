Women think I'm tasty
But they're always tryin' to waste me
And make me burn the candle right down
But baby, baby
Don't need no jewels in my crown

'Cause all you women is low down gamblers
Cheatin' like I don't know how
But baby, I go crazy
There's fever in the funk house now

This low down bitchin' got my poor feet a-itchin'
You know you know the deuce is still wild
Baby, can't stay
You got to roll me and call me the tumblin' dice

Always in a hurry, I never stop to worry
Don't you see the time flashin' by
Honey, got no money
I'm all sixes and sevens and nines

Say now, baby, I'm the rank outsider
You can be my partner in crime
Baby, can't stay
You got to roll me and call me the tumblin'
Roll me and call me the tumblin' dice

Oh my my my, I'm the lone crap shooter
Playin' the field every night
Baby, can't stay
You got to roll me and call me the tumblin'
Roll me and call me the tumblin' dice

Got to roll me
Got to roll me
Got to roll me
Got to roll me
Got to roll me
Got to roll me
Got to roll me

Keep on rolling
Got to roll me
Keep on rolling
Got to roll me
Keep on rolling
Got to roll me

Got to roll me
Got to roll me
Got to roll me
Got to roll me
Got to roll me
Got to roll me
Got to roll me
Got to roll me
