Care about no history,
I just wanna go and raise a family with you,
Raise 'em true, raise 'em properly
I'm built for cover do it built for speed,
And I wanna go fast so gimme what I need now,
I bet you hear that all the time
I've been watchin' you sitting there,
And I wanna pull you near

Words are clever,
Hands are better,
So let's put them together
Do you want what I got?
'Cause I need your company
If you doubt a thing that I say,
And you're tired of playing games, I'm in!

I'm gonna get you those precious things,
Like old brand whiskey and chicken wings,
See that's a promise I can keep
I like cashmere I like your sweater,
But if you take it off we'll both feel better,
You know I'll help you happily
If these lights are low enough,
No one's gonna see you blush

Words are clever,
Hands are better,
So let's put them together
Do you want what I got?
'Cause I need your company
If you doubt a thing that I say,
And you're tired of playing games, I'm in!

(Ooh)
There's only so much I can say,
To convince you
No words that have their place,
Not in a bedroom
Said I don't care if you go
Well, that's a lie, 'cause I do

Words are clever,
Hands are better,
So let's put them together
Do you want what I got?
'Cause I need your company
If you doubt a thing that I say,
And you're tired of playing games, I'm in!

Words are clever,
Hands are better,
So let's put them together
Do you want what I got?
'Cause I need your company
If you doubt a thing that I say,
And you're tired of playing games, I'm in!

And you're tired of playing games, I'm in!
