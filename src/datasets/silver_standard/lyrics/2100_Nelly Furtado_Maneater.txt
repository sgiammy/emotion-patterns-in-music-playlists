Come on everybody what you here for
Move your body around like a nympho

Everybody get your neck to crack around
All you crazy people come on jump around
I wanna see you all on your knees knees
You either wanna be with me or be me

Make you spend hard make you want all of her love
She's a maneater make you buy cars
Make you cut cards make you fall real hard in love
She's a maneater make you work hard
Make you spend hard make you want all of her love
She's a maneater make you buy cars
Make you cut cards wish you never ever met her at all

And when she walks she walks with passion
When she talks she talks like she can handle it
When she asks for something boy she means it

You doing anything to keep her by your side
Because she says she love you, love you long time
