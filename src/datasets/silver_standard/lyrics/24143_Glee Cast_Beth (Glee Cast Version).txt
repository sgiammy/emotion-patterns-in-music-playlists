Puck:
Beth, I hear you callin'
But I can't come home right now
Me and the boys are playin'
And we just can't find the sound

New Directions boys:
Just a few more hours
And I'll be right home to you
I think I hear them callin'
Oh Beth, what can I do?
Beth, what can I do?

Finn:
You say you feel so empty
That our house just ain't a home
And I'm always somewhere else
And you're always there alone

New Directions boys:
Just a few more hours
And I'll be right home to you
I think I hear them callin'
Oh Beth, what can I do?
Beth, what can I do?

Puck:
Beth, I know you're lonely
And I hope you'll be all right
'Cause me and the boys will be playin' all night
