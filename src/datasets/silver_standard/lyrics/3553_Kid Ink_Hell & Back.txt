I've been through hell and back

I fire back
In this cold world
Where your light is at
Just burn it down
Fire back

Uh, let's take it to the ground
Done too many make it coming to our town
Looking for a detour nowhere to be found
When the pressure's on seems nobody's around
Uh, but I won't let them see me sweat
Ye it took a little time,
But can't really be upset
Long way to the top,
I can barely see the steps
Yeah, they sleeping on me still
But I barely need to rest
See me standing here hand high
Face up, I don't need no X-Ray
Show you what I'm made of
Tell 'em I paid my dosen
You can check the paystocks
Never had a chance so
I had to go and make one
Say some You can tell them that
I've been through hell and back
But I'm home, can't really complain when
It's the life that I chose
Sacrificied it all and everything that I owned
Say "What doesn't kill me can only make me stronger"

Yo can you feel the heat
The block is hot as ever
In these city streets
You only get one shot
Keep your arm steady
They tried to make me wait
But I'm more than ready
To go and get my grind liker and line
Skater check your wrist watch you'll see that
This time it's my time,
And I don't need no invite
To the party, got roll over menace and
Feels like my calling, uh
I'm just doing what I can
With a whole lot of drive
Trying to make my own path
Take a chance, can't sit and worry about
No 5-year plan gotta live for the day
'Cause I could die where I stand
Tell 'em
You can tell them that
