I watched you walk away
Hopeless, with nothing to say
I strain my eyes
Hoping to see you again

This is my curse (The longing)
This is my curse (Time)
This is my curse (The yearning)
This is my curse

There is love burning to find you
Will you wait for me?
Will you be there?

Your silence haunts me
But still I hunger for you

This is my curse (The wanting)
This is my curse (Time)
This is my curse (The needing)
This is my curse

There is love burning to find you
Will you wait for me?

And still I want
And still I ache
But still I wait
To see you again

Dying inside these walls
Dying inside these walls

And I see your face
In these tears, in these tears
And I see your face

There is love (There is love)
There is love (There is love)
There is love (There is love)
There is love (There is love)
