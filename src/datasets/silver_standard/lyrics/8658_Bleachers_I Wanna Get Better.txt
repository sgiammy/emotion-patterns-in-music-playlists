Hey, I hear the voice of a preacher from the back room
Calling my name and I follow just to find you
I trace the faith to a broken down television
And put on the weather

And I've trained myself to give up on the past
'Cause I frozen time between hearses and caskets
Lost control when I panicked at the acid test
I wanna get better

While my friends were getting high and chasing girls
Down parkway lines, I was losing my mind
'Cause the love, the love, the love, the love, the love
That I gave wasted on a nice face

In a blaze of fear I put a helmet on a helmet
Counting seconds through the night and got carried away
So now I'm standing on the overpass screaming at the cars
"Hey, I wanna get better!"

I didn't know I was lonely till I saw your face
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better
I didn't know I was broken till I wanted to change
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better

I go up to my room and there's girls on the ceiling
Cut out their pictures and I chase that feeling
Of an eighteen year old who didn't know what loss was
Now I'm a stranger

And I miss the days of a life still permanent
Mourn the years before I got carried away
So now I'm staring at the interstate screaming at myself
"Hey, I wanna get better!"

I didn't know I was lonely till I saw your face
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better
I didn't know I was broken till I wanted to change
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better

'Cause I'm sleeping in the back of a taxi
I'm screaming from my bedroom window
Even if it's gonna kill me

Woke up this morning early before my family
From this dream where she was trying to show me
How a life can move from the darkness
She said to get better

So I put a bullet where I shoulda put a helmet
And I crash my car 'cause I wanna get carried away
That's why I'm standing on the overpass screaming at myself
"Hey, I wanna get better!"

I didn't know I was lonely till I saw your face
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better
I didn't know I was broken till I wanted to change
I wanna get better, better, better, better
I wanna get better
