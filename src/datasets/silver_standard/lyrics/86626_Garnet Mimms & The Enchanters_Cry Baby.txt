Cry, cry, baby
Cry, baby
Cry, baby
Welcome back home

Now he told you
That he loved you much more than I
But he left you
And you don't, you just don't know why
And when you don't know what to do
You come running and start to

Cry, cry, baby
Cry, baby
Cry, baby
Like you always do

Don't you know
Nobody can love you the way that I do
Take the pain and the heartache too
Ah, honey, you know I'll be around
When you need me, so go on and

Cry, cry, baby
Cry, baby
Cry, baby
Welcome back home

I've spent so many nights
Just waiting for you to come walking through that door
And even though you've made a fool of me so many times before
I know that all it takes is just the sight of your face
To make me realize that I'll always love you, darling
And I can see that you got some more tears to shed
I can see it, baby, because your eyes, your eyes are getting red
So come on (yeah), come on (yeah), come on (yeah), come on (yeah), come on (yeah)
Come on and

Cry, cry, baby
Cry, baby
Cry, baby
Cry, baby
