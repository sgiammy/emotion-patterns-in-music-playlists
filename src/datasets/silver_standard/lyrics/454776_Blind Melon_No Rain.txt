Ooh, hoo hoo hoo
Hoo hoo hoo

All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
I like watchin' the puddles gather rain
And all I can do is just pour some tea for two
And speak my point of view, but it's not sane
It's not sane

I just want someone to say to me, no oh oh oh
I'll always be there when you wake, and a-yeah-hea
You know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today
So stay with me and I'll have it made

And I don't understand why I sleep all day
And I start to complain that there's no rain
And all I can do is read a book to stay awake
And it rips my life away, but it's a great escape
Escape, escape, escape

Oh yeah
Ooh, hoo hoo
Whoa

All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
You don't like my point of view, you think that I'm insane
It's not sane, it's not sane

I just want someone to say to me, no oh oh oh
I'll always be there when you wake, and a-yeah-hea
You know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today
So stay with me and I'll have it made

Lord, and I'll have it made
Ooh, and I'll have it made
Oh-ho
Lord, I'm gonna
You know I'm really gonna, really gonna have it made, yeah-hea
You know I'll have it made

Oh-oh-oh-oh (I'll have it made)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (I'll have it made)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (I'll have it made)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (I'll have it made)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
