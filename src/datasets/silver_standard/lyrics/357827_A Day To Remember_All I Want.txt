I'm always screaming my lungs out 'til my head starts spinning.
Playing my songs is the way I cope with life.
Won't keep my voice down.
Know the words I speak are the thoughts I think out loud.
I like to keep things honest.
I'm a set bet, like you life's staked on it.
For real, I'd hate to keep you all wondering.
I'm constant like the seasons, and I will never be forgotten, man.

Let's leave no words unspoken, and save regrets for the broken.
Will you even look back when you think of me?
All I want is a place to call my own to mend the hearts on everyone who feels alone.
You know to keep your hopes up high and your head down low.

Keep your hopes up high and your head down low.

Still got something left to prove.
It tends to keep things movin' while everyone around me says my lasts days are looming overhead.
What the hell so they think they know?
I keep my head above water while they drown in the undertow.

Let's leave no words unspoken and save regrets for the broken.
Will you even look back when you think of me?
All I want is a place to call my own to mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone.
You know to keep your hopes up high and your head down low.

All I want is a place to call my own to mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone.
You know to keep your hopes up high and your head down low.

If you take it from me, live your life for yourself.
'Cause when it's all said and done, you don't need anyone else.
Come on.

So let's go back to when everything seemed perfect, not a worry in the world.
So tell me, was it all worth it?
I get what I want, so everyone's always judging me.
I'm not afraid of anything, and I've got the whole world in front of me.

All I want is a place to call my own to mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone.
You know to keep your hopes up high and your head down low.

All I want is a place to call my own to mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone.
You know to keep your hopes up high and your head down low.

Keep your heads down low.
Keep you heads down low.
Keep your hopes up high and your head down low.
