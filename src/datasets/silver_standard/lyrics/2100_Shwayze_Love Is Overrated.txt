I just wanna fuck tonight
Love is overrated
I don't wanna take my time
'Cause that gets complicated
And you get, you get so jaded
Please don't, please don't think were dating
I just wanna fuck tonight
Love is overrated

Raised in a trailer by the beaches
Now I got different spots all over like a cheetah
Knew this white girl, ass like bonita
But she act like she don't wanna, when you act like you need her
Fell in love once and she cheat cheat cheated
So I fucked her best friend till she skeet skeet skeeted
Heartbroken and I won't repeat it
Ain't looking for love unless is backseated

Anytime is the right time
Come alive in the night time
Body surfing high tide
All for the thrill of the ride
But I ain't looking for love
I ain't looking for love
I ain't looking for love tonight
I ain't looking for love
I ain't looking for love
I just wanna have a good time

I just wanna fuck tonight
Love is overrated
I don't wanna take my time
'Cause that gets complicated
And you get, you get so jaded
Please don't, please don't think were dating
I just wanna fuck tonight
Love is overrated

La la la la la love is overrated
La la la la la love is overrated
La la la la la love is overrated
La la la la la love is overrated

Ain't no wrong way to eat it like a Reese's
And she eating Adderall so she ain't really sleeping
Had her heartbroken into itty-bitty pieces
Now she in the night club straight looking for a reason
Fell in love once and he cheat cheat cheated
So she fucked his best friend, man he couldn't believe it
Got back together then it all repeated
I ain't looking for love man I don't need it

Anytime is the right time
Come alive in the night time
Body surfing high tide
All for the thrill of the ride
But I ain't looking for love
I ain't looking for love
I ain't looking for love tonight
I ain't looking for love
I ain't looking for love
I just wanna have a good time

I just wanna fuck tonight
Love is overrated
I don't wanna take my time
'Cause that gets complicated
And you get, you get so jaded
Please don't, please don't think were dating
I just wanna fuck tonight
Love is overrated

La la la la la love is overrated
La la la la la love is overrated
La la la la la love is overrated
La la la la la love is overrated
