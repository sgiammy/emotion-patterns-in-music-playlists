Louie, Louie, oh no, I said we gotta go
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I said
Louie, Louie, oh baby, I said we gotta go

A fine little girl, she waits for me
Me catch a ship, across the sea
Me sail that ship, a-all alone
Me never think how I'll make it home

A-Louie, Louie, nah, nah, nah, nah, I said we gotta go
Oh no, I said
Louie, Louie, oh baby, I said we gotta go

(Fuck!)

Three nights, and days I sailed the sea
Think of girl, all constantly
Oh on that ship, I dream she there
I smell the rose, oh in her hair

Louie, Louie, oh no, I said we gotta go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I said
Louie, Louie, oh baby, said we gotta go

Okay let's give it to 'em right now!

Me see
Me see Jamaica, the moon above
It won't be long, me see me love
Me take her in my arms and then
I tell her I'll never leave again

Louie, Louie, oh no, I said we gotta go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah I said
A-Louie, Louie, oh baby, I said we gotta go

I said we gotta go now

Let's hustle on outta here

Let's go!
