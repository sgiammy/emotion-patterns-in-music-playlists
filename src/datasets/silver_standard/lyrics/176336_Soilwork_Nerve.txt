Call it liberation or frustration
As it hits like a bomb
Tearing you apart as you're first in line
Entering the zone

Watch how it runs
A nerve-wrecking resistance
Watch how it burns
A venomous script's getting formed

You've travelled a long way to get here
And now its waking you up
Waking you up

Walk straight for a final solution
Walk straight, don't you be so cold
Walk straight with a clear resolution
I'll state my case and never turn

Watch how it runs, watch how it burns
And it's all a deception
Break it and learn, there's no return
For a presence like mine

You've travelled a long way to get here

It's getting all so clear now, all the things at last
An elapse of conscious progress will last for ever more

My courageous insanity follows an infinite time
I'll be attaching the world on my shoulders without a look inside
Inside

Walk straight for a final solution
Walk straight, don't you be so cold
Walk straight with a clear resolution
I'll state my case and never turn
Walk straight for a final solution
Walk straight, don't you be so cold
Walk straight with a clear resolution
