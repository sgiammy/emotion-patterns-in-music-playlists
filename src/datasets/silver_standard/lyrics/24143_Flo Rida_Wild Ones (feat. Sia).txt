Hey I heard you were a wild one, ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you'll do
I want to shut down the club with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones, ooh

(Flo Rida)
I like crazy, foolish, stupid
Party going wild, fist pumping music,
I might lose it
Blast through the roof,
That's how we do's it, do's it, do's it

I don't care tonight, she don't care
We like almost there, the right vibe
Ready to get live, ain't no surprise
Take me so high, jumping those dives
Surfin' the crowd

Ooh ooh
Said I gotta be the man, I'm the head of my fam,
Mike check, one two, ooh
Shut them down in the club when the Playboy does,

And they all get loose, loose
Out the bottle, we all get bent and again tomorrow
Gotta break rules 'cause that's the motto
Club shut down, a hundred supermodels

(Sia)
Hey I heard you were a wild one, ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you'll do
I want to shut down the club with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones, ooh

(Flo Rida)
Party rocker, fo' sho' stopper
More shampoo
Number one club popper
Got a hangover like too much vodka
Can't see me with ten binoculars

So cool
No doubt by the end of the night
Got the clothes coming off
Then I make that move
Somehow, someway, gotta raise the roof, roof
All black shades when the sun come through

Oh, it's on like everything goes
Riled up baby to the freaky show
What happens to that body is a private show
Stays right here, pri-private show

I like 'em untamed, don't tell me 'bout pain
Tell 'em this, bottoms up with the champagne
My life, coming harder than we hit play
Do you busy with the bail, were you insane?

(Sia)
Hey I heard you were a wild one, ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you'll do
I want to shut down the club with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones, ooh

I am a wild one, break me in
Saddle me up and let's begin
I am a wild one, tame me now
Running with wolves, and I'm on the prowl

(Flo Rida)
I show you another side of me
A side you would never thought you'd see
Tear up that body, dominate you, till you had enough
I heard you like the wilds, don't lie

(Sia)
Hey I heard you were a wild one, ooh
If I took you home, it'd be a home run
Show me how you'll do
I want to shut down the club with you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones, ooh

I am a wild one, break me in
Saddle me up and let's begin
I am a wild one, tame me now
Running with wolves, and I'm on the prowl
