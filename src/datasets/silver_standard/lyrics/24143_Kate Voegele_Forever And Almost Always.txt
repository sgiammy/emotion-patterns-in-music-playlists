So the story goes on down
A less traveled road.
It's a variation on the one I was told,
And although it's not the same,
It's awful close
In an ordinary fairy tale land,
There's a promise of a perfect happy end.
And I imagine having just short of that,
Is better than nothing

So you'll be mine,
Forever and almost always,
And I'll be fine,
Just love me when you can
And I'll wait patiently,
I'll wake up everyday
Just hoping that,
You still care

In the corner of my mind,
I know too well,
Oh that surely even I,
Deserve the best
But instead of leaving,
I just put the issue to bed,
And out of my head...

Oh and just when I believe,
You've changed for good.
Well you go and prove me wrong,
Just like I knew you would
When I've run out of second chances,
You give me that look,
And you're off the hook...

Because you're mine,
Forever and almost always,
And I'll be fine,
Just love me when you can
And I'll wait patiently,
I'll wake up everyday
Just hoping that,
You still care

What am I still doing here?
It's all becoming so clear...

You'll be mine,
Forever and almost always,
It ain't right
To just love me when you can
I won't wait patiently,
Or wake up everyday
Just hoping that,
You'll still care
Forever and almost always,
No it ain't right
To just love me when you can, baby
Ain't gonna wait patiently,
I won't wake up every day
Just hoping that,
You'll still care...
