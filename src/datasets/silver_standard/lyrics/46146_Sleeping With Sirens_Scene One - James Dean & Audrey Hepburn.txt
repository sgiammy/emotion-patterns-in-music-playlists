Stay for the night
If you want to, I can show you
What my dreams are made of,
As I'm dreaming of your face.

I've been awake for a long time,
Such a long time, that I miss you now.
I can't image being anywhere else.
I can't imagine being anywhere else but here.

How the hell did you ever pick me?
Honestly, I could sing you a song.
But I don't think words can express your beauty.
It's singing to me.
How the hell did we end up like this?
You bring out the beast in me.
I fell in love from the moment we kissed.
Since then, we've been history.

They say that love is forever, 
Your forever is all that I need.
Please stay as long as you need. 
Can't promise that things won't be broken,
But I swear that I will never leave.
Please stay forever with me. 

If you want to, I can show you,
What my dreams are made of.
If you want to, I can show you.

It goes to show, 
I hope that you know that you are,
What my dreams are made of.
And I can't fall asleep,
I lay in my bed awake at night.

And I fall in love,
You fall in love. 
It could mean everything,
Everything to me.
Ooh, ooh,
This could mean everything,
Everything to me.

They say that love is forever, 
Your forever is all that I need.
Please stay as long as you need. 
Can't promise that things won't be broken,
But I swear that I will never leave.
Please stay forever,

The way that we are,
Is the reason I stay.
As long as you're here with me,
I know I'll be okay. 

They say that love is forever, 
Your forever is all that I need.
Please stay, 
Please stay as long as you need. 
Can't promise that things won't be broken,
But I swear that I will never leave.
Please stay forever with me. 

It goes to show, 
I hope that you know that you are,
What my dreams are made of.

(It goes to show, 
I hope that you know that you are,
What my dreams are made of.)

Please stay, 
Please stay as long as you need.

(It goes to show, 
I hope that you know that you are,
What my dreams are made of.)

(They say that love is forever, 
Your forever is all that I need.)

Please stay, 
Please stay forever with me.
