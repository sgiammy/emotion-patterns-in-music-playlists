You and me
Got ourselves a problem
I can see this
Better than I solve 'em

I believed
I found a way around it
I will leave this
Better than I found it

There’s too much smoke to see it
There’s too much broke to feel this
Well, I love you, I love you
And all of your pieces

There’s too much smoke to see it
There’s too much broke to feel this
Well, I love you, I love you
And all of your pieces

History’s a letter made of scarlet
Victories look better when you’ve called it
Misery’s the moment when I lost you
It’s pleasure in a costume
It’s more than what it cost you

There’s too much smoke to see it
There’s too much broke to feel this
Well, I love you, I love you
And all of your pieces

There’s too much smoke to see it
There’s too much broke to feel this
Well, I love you, I love you
And all of your pieces

All of your pieces
All of your pieces
All of your pieces

All of your pieces
All of your pieces
All of your pieces

There’s too much smoke to see it
There’s too much broke to feel this
Well, I love you, I love you
And all of your pieces

There’s too much smoke to see it
There’s too much broke to feel this
Well, I love you, I love you
And all of your pieces
