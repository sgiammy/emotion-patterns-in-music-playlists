You call me on the telephone, you feel so far away
You tell me to come over, there's some games you want to play
I'm walking to your house, nobody's home
It's just me and you and you and me alone

We're just playing hide and seek
It's getting hard to breathe under the sheets with you
I don't want to play no games
I'm tired of always chasing, chasing after you

I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Whoever said I give a shit about you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you

Wake up in your bedroom and there's nothing left to say
When I try to talk you're always playing board games
I wish I had monopoly over your mind
I wish I didn't care all the time

We're just playing hide and seek
It's getting hard to breathe under the sheets with you
I don't want to play no games
I'm tired of always chasing, chasing after you

I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Whoever said I give a shit about you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you

Ring around the rosy
I never know, I never know what you need
Ring around the rosy
I wanna give you, wanna give you what you need

I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Whoever said I give a shit about you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you

You know I give a fuck about you everyday
Guess it's time that I tell you the truth
If I share my toys, will you let me stay?
Don't wanna leave this play date with you
