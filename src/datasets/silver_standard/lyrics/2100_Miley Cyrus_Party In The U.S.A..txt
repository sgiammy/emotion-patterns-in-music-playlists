I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess, whoa
Am I gonna fit in?

Jumped in a cab 
Here I am for the first time
Look to my right
And I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

My tummy's turnin'
And I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio 

And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on
And a Jay-Z song was on

So I put my hands up
They're playing my song
The butterflies fly away
Nodding my head like, yeah
Moving my hips like, yeah

I put my hands up
They're playing my song
You know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah
It's a party in the U.S.A.
Yeah
It's a party in the U.S.A.

Get to the club in my taxicab
Everybody's looking at me now
Like, "Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks?
She's gotta be from outta town"

So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo

My tummy's turnin'
And I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune

And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on

So I put my hands up
They're playing my song
The butterflies fly away
Nodding my head like, yeah
Moving my hips like, yeah

Got my hands up
They're playing my song
You know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah
It's a party in the U.S.A.
Yeah
It's a party in the U.S.A.

Feel like hopping on a flight
Back to my hometown tonight
Something stops me every time
The DJ plays my song and I feel all right

So I put my hands up
They're playing my song
And the butterflies fly away
Nodding my head like, yeah
Moving my hips like, yeah

Got my hands up
They're playing my song
You know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah
It's a party in the U.S.A.
Yeah
It's a party in the U.S.A.

So I put my hands up
They're playing my song
The butterflies fly away
Nodding my head like, yeah
Moving my hips like, yeah

Got my hands up
They're playing my song
You know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah
It's a party in the U.S.A.
Yeah
It's a party in the U.S.A.
