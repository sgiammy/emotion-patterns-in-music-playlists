She's a very kinky girl
The kind you don't take home to mother
She will never let your spirits down
Once you get her off the street, ow, girl

She likes the boys in the band
She says that I'm her all-time favorite
When I make my move to her room, it's the right time
She's never hard to please
Ow, no

That girl is pretty wild, now
(The girl's a super freak)
The kind of girl you read about
(In new-wave magazines)
That girl is pretty kinky
(The girl's a super freak)
I really love to taste her
(Every time we meet)

She's all right, she's all right
That girl's all right with me, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, hey

She's a super freak, super freak
She's super freaky, yow
(Everybody sing)
Super freak, super freak

She's a very special girl
(The kind of girl you want to know)
From her head down to her toenails
(Down to her feet, yeah)
And she'll wait for me at backstage with her girlfriends
In a limousine
(Long and black and shiny car) 
Three's not a crowd to her, she says
(Ménage à trois, ooh la la!)
"Room 714, I'll be waiting"
When I get there she's got incense, wine, and candles
It's such a freaky scene

That girl is pretty kinky
(The girl's a super freak)
The kind of girl you read about
(In new-wave magazines)
That girl is pretty wild, now
(The girl's a super freak)
I really like to taste her
(Every time we meet)

She's all right, she's all right
That girl's all right with me, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, hey

She's a super freak, super freak
She's super freaky, yow
Temptations, sing!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Super freak, super freak
That girl's a super freak
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

She's a very kinky girl
The kind you won't take home to mother
And she will never let your spirits down
Once you get her off the street
Blow, Danny!
Ow, girl
Ow, girl
