Do you spend your days counting the hours you're awake?
And when night covers the sky you find yourself doing the same
There's a burden you've been bearing in spite of all your prayers
As a light turns off inside your heart 
Can you remember what it's like to care?

Knees are weak, hands are shaking, I can't breathe

So give me the drug, keep me alive
Give me what's left of my life
Don't let me go, whooaa
Pull this plug, let me breathe
On my own, I'm finally free
Don't let me go, whooaa

The trail of crumbs you left somehow got lost along the way
If you never meant to leave then you only had to stay
But the memories that haunt us are cherished just the same
As the ones that bring us closer to the sky, no matter how grey. 

Yet I fall, through these clouds, reaching, screaming

Give me the drug, keep me alive
Give me what's left of my life
Don't let me go, whooaa
Pull this plug, let me breathe
On my own, I'm finally free
Don't let me go, whooaa

This grip loosens but it never breaks (never breaks)
We carry nothing but a name you will forsake
Your words are always there to break my fall (break my fall!)
In them I find the comfort to see through it all

Guide me through uncharted waters
Before we lose our way again
Will you be my compass until forever - until forever ends?

Knees are weak, hands are shaking, I can't breathe

So give me the drug, keep me alive
Give me what's left of my life
Don't let me go, whooaa
Pull this plug, let me breathe
On my own, I'm finally free
Don't let me go, whooaa

Don't let me go, whooaa
Don't let me go, whooaa
