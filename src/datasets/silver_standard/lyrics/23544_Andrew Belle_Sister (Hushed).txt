Sister, I remember
Mother kept happy when she could
Weather in December
Never felt as warm as it should
You were like a feather
Never land where we thought you would
Or anywhere close to it
Who would have thought you never would?

So, tell me what happens

When the waves break
And you're surrounded
He tries to kill you
And you allow it

Sister, I remember
The morning light on evergreen
What seemed like forever
Was just my mind escaping me
Imitation leather
The smell of blood left on the seat
Was that your way of proving
We look the same from underneath

So, tell me what happens

When the waves break
And you're surrounded
He tries to kill you
And you allow it
And you allow it

Over and over he says
I surround you
I surround you
I never leave my beloved
I've found you

I surround you
I surround you, I
I never leave my beloved
I've found you
