I got a black shoe lace, painted face
I slit my wrist in a state of grace
I got a dreadful clothes, no one knows
I bleed every night from my broken nose

My blood sinks down to the canvas
I'm going down, down, down
My blood sinks down to the canvas
I'm going down, down, down, down, down

The girl who loved the monsters
Traces black streaks in the sky
The girl who loved the monsters
Is the girl who wants to fly

I am a child in need, watch me bleed
How can I live if I can not feed
I am a animal, no one's knows
I limp around on broken toes

Blood sinks down to the canvas
I'm going down, down, down
My blood sinks down to the canvas
I'm going down, down, down, down, down

The girl who loved the monsters
Traces black streaks in the sky
The girl who loved the monsters
Is the girl who wants to fly

Set them free, let them be
The monsters live in you and me
Set them free, let them be
The monsters live in you and me

The girl who loved the monsters
Traces black streaks in the sky
The girl who loved the monsters
Is the girl who wants to fly

The caged bird sings and looks to the gods
Oh spare me another day of whipped worshipped dogs
We're all mad here, and feed off the gold
Mirror mocks the eye as we keep getting old
