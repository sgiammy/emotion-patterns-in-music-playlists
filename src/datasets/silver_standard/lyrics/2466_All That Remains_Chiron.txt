Have not the strongest
And closest ties been bound so long
I've called upon them
They remind me where I'm from
With deep conviction
I am connected across the miles
Without them, nothing worth relying on

It's been so long since I could say
I've needed anything stronger
We can't be wrong when we have ties that bind us
If I rely and I know the strength
In those who taught me of the
Power in the ties that bind

When I turn inward
And look for strength within myself
And demonstrations of courage
Are the result
If inspiration is wholly shared
Then more is the gain
Then I will follow
The selfless actions displayed

It's been so long since I could say
I've needed anything stronger
We can't be wrong when we have ties that bind us
If I rely and I know the strength
In those who taught me of the
Power in the ties that bind

We are made powerful
