Pitbull:
Ask for money and get advice
Ask for advice, get money twice
I'm from the Dirty but that chico nice
Y'all call it a moment, I call it life

Christina Aguilera:
One day when the light is glowing
I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just wanna feel this moment (oh oh)
I just wanna feel this moment (oh oh)
I just wanna feel this moment

Pitbull:
Mr. Worldwide
Christina Aguilera
Oye mamita, (I just wanna feel this moment) come on, dale
Que la cosa esta rica

Feel this moment...

Pitbull:
Reporting live, from the tallest building in Tokyo
Long ways from the hard ways
Bill sos and oh yeas
They count it always, 305 all day
Now baby we can party, oh baby we can party

She read books, especially about red rooms and tight ups
I got it hooked 'cause she seen me in a suit with the red ta-ta up
Meet and greet, nice to meet ya, but time is money
Only difference is I own it, now let's stop time and enjoy this moment

Christina Aguilera:
One day when the light is glowing
I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just wanna feel this moment (oh oh)
I just wanna feel this moment (oh oh)
I just wanna feel this moment

Feel this moment...

Pitbull:
I see the future but live for the moment, make sense, don't it?
Now make dollars, I mean billions, I'm a genius, I mean brilliant
This street is what scoot 'em
And made 'em slicker to slick with the ruler

I've lost a lot and learned a lot
But I'm still undefeated like Zula
I'm far from cheap, I break down companies with all my peeps
Baby we can travel the world

And not given view and all you can see
Time is money
Only difference is I own it
Like a stopwatch, let's stop time and enjoy this moment

Christina Aguilera:
One day when the light is glowing
I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just wanna feel this moment (oh oh)
I just wanna feel this moment (oh oh)
I just wanna feel this moment

Come on, feel this moment...

Christina Aguilera
(Oh) I just wanna feel this moment
(Oh) I just wanna feel this moment
