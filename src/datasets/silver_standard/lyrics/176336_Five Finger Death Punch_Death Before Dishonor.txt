To the haters, the takers, the liars, all the vultures,
And the bottom-feeding scum
The FCC, the FBI, and every tin god with a badge and a gun
You talk and talk; you preach and bitch
But your words don't mean a thing
You get what you give; you give what you get
Just the way it's always been

I choose death before dishonor
I'd rather die than live down on my knees
Bury me like a soldier with my dignity!

You imitate the ostracized
Put your head beneath the sand
Your cup, it runneth over
Must be rough to live so grand

You reap what you sow; you pay what you owe 
Unless you bathe yourself in greed
You rob and you take; your world is fake
There's no honor amongst the thieves

I choose death before dishonor
I'd rather die than live down on my knees
Bury me like a soldier with my dignity!

Fuck!
You're self-righteous, self-pretentious
Your ways are not for me
You're deluded, so confused
Your world is not for me

I choose death before dishonor
I'd rather die than live down on my knees
Bury me like a soldier

Bury me, bury me
Bury me, bury me
Bury me, with my dignity
