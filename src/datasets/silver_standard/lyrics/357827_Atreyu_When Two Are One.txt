Bang!
Explosions in my head that just won't quit
A train has crashed into the wall
Around my heart and left the old me dead
Obliterated
Stop!
My breathing in the night when you're not there
The silence ringing through my ears
And all I want to do is hear your voice
But you're not there

Drawn together
Painter's brush stroke
Sleight of hand, we
We won't go up in smoke
Fates colliding
Love undying

Like the rising tide
Beating hearts grow but never die
To simplify
I'll stand by your side
Close my eyes
Hope will never die (never die)

Like the rising tide
Beating hearts grow but never die
To simplify
I'll stand by your side
Close my eyes
Hope will never die (never die)

Go!
And take away the pain of being me
Soothe my soul, caress my heart and
End my fear, all my bad memories
Eradicated
Ring!
Like gunshots heard against a silent night
My love is louder then these words
They're stronger then the rest, unstoppable
Unstoppable

Drawn together
Painter's brush stroke
Sleight of hand, we
We won't go up in smoke
Fates colliding
Love undying

Like the rising tide
Beating hearts grow but never die
To simplify
I'll stand by your side
Close my eyes
Hope will never die (never die)

Like the rising tide
Beating hearts grow but never die
To simplify
I'll stand by your side
Close my eyes
Hope will never die (never die)
Will never die (never die)

Die

Drawn together
Painter's brush stroke
Sleight of hand, we
We won't go up in smoke
Fates colliding
Love undying

Like the rising tide
Beating hearts grow but never die
To simplify
I'll stand by your side
Close my eyes
Hope will never die (never die)

Like the rising tide
Beating hearts grow but never die
To simplify
I'll stand by your side
Close my eyes
Hope will never die (never die)
Will never die (never die)

Die

Yeah
