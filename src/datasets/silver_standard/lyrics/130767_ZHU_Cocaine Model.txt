I asked her can I have your number
Looks like blue must be your color
Love the way you wear that dress
Even though your hair's a mess
She said its Isabel Marant
And I got everything you want
Only questions can you hang
Will you come and entertain?

I will, I will, I will
Never forget the thrill
We know we know we know
What we came for
What we came for

They don't got it like that where you from
If you give me what I want I'll give it to you right back
If you give me what I want I'll give it to you right back

She told me was from Morocco
By the way of south Chicago
Graduated in the bay
Had her birthday in LA
Said I had to go to Paris
Private jets on her parents
Asked me if I wanna roll
I said if you take me home

I will, I will, I will
Never forget the thrill
'Cause we know we know we know
What we came for
What we came for

They don't got it like that where you from
If you give me what I want I'll give it to you right back
If you give me what I want I'll give it to you right back
