"Someway, baby, it's part of me, apart from me"
You're laying waste to Halloween
You fucked it friend, it's on it's head, it struck the street
You're in Milwaukee, off your feet

And at once I knew I was not magnificent
Strayed above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
For I could see for miles, miles, miles

3rd and Lake it burnt away, the hallway
Was where we learned to celebrate
The automatic bought the years you'd talk for me
That night you played me “Lit Parade”
Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree
Saying nothing, that's enough for me

And at once I knew I was not magnificent
Hulled far from the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
For I could see for miles, miles, miles

Christmas night, it clutched the light
The hallow bright
Above my brother, I and tangled spines
We smoked the screen to make it what it was to be
Now to know it in my memory

And at once I knew I was not magnificent
High above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
For I could see for miles, miles, miles
