You said you hate yourself
So let me feed you strawberries
Off a plate I bought from a widow
Who was selling her husband's things
And we'll see if you still hate yourself

If you still hate yourself
I'll eat you out for an hour in your room
'Cause I love giving head

If you still hate yourself
We'll cut ourselves and swallow
Chunks of broken glass
I don't care about finishing college

I'll buy the biggest TV
That my credit card allows me
We'll watch the Food Network for the rest of our lives
