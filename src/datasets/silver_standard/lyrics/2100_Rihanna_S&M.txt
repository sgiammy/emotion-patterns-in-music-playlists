Feels so good being bad (oh oh oh oh oh)
There's no way I'm turning back (oh oh oh oh oh)
Now the pain is my pleasure
'Cause nothing could measure (oh oh oh oh oh)

Love is great, love is fine  (oh oh oh oh oh)
Outta box, outta line (oh oh oh oh oh)
The affliction of the feeling
Leaves me wanting more (oh oh oh oh oh)

'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it (na na na)

Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it

Love is great, love is fine (oh oh oh oh oh)
Outta box, outta line (oh oh oh oh oh)
The affliction of the feeling
Leaves me wanting more (oh oh oh oh oh)

'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

Na na na
Come on, come on, come on
I like it like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it like it (na na na)

Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it

Oh, I love the feeling you bring to me, oh, you turn me on
It's exactly what I've been yearning for, give it to me strong
And meet me in my boudoir
Make my body say ah, ah, ah

I like it like it

'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones

Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it
