You saw my pain, washed out in the rain
Broken glass, saw the blood run from my veins
But you saw no fault, no cracks in my heart
And you knelt beside, my hope torn apart

But the ghosts that we knew
Will flicker from view
And we'll live a long life

So give me hope in the darkness
That I will see the light
Cause oh, they gave me such a fright
But I will hold as long as you like
Just promise me we'll be alright

So lead me back, turn south from that place
And close my eyes, to my recent disgrace
Cause you know my call, and will share my all
And our children come and they will hear me roar

So give me hope in the darkness
That I will see the light
Cause oh, they gave me such a fright
But I will hold as long as you like
Just promise me we'll be alright

But hold me still, bury my heart on the cold
And hold me still, bury my heart next to yours

So give me hope in the darkness
That I will see the light
Cause oh, they gave me such a fright
But I will hold on with all of my might
Just promise me we'll be alright

But the ghosts that we knew
Made us black and all blue
And we'll live a long life

And the ghosts that we knew
Will flicker from view
And we'll live a long life
