Free at last, finally tasting happiness
Five years of hell for nothing
Trapped inside the minds of failures

A wise man once said
"That which does not kill us makes us stronger."
But we were dead, so are we now invincible?

Determination
Perseverance
Resolution
Resurrection

Final straw, underlying ignorance
Consumed by greed and hate (and hate)
Kept under the feet of tyrants

Reality kicked in, raced against time
Just to start all over
Treated like shit
Pushed aside and expendable

Determination
Perseverance
Resolution
Resurrection

We have become
So goddamn powerful

All the beatings you gave us
We will use them against you
All the beatings you gave us (you gave us)
We will use them against you (against you)

Determination
Perseverance
Resolution
Resurrection

Free at last, finally tasting happiness
The Resurrection
