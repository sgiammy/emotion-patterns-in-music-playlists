Kyla
Baby, I like your style!

Drake
Grips on your waist
Front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe
But I never run away
Even when I'm away

Oti, oti
There's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray

That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

Kyla
Baby, I like your style!

Drake
Strength and guidance
All that I'm wishing for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence

You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time

And that's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

Wizkid
Got a pretty girl and she love me long time
Wine it, wine it, very long time
Oh yeah, very long time
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
Back up, back up and wine it, girl
Back up, back up, back up and wine it
Oh yeah, very long time
Back, up, back up and wine it, girl

Kyla
Tell me
I need to know, where do you wanna go?
'Cause if you're down, I'll take it slow
Make you lose control

Kyla (Wizkid)
Where, where, where
Where, where, where, where

Oh yeah, very long time
Where, where, where
Back, up, back up and wine it, girl
Where, where, where, where

'Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and
'Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and
'Cause if you're down
Back up, back up and

Drake
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
