Back up off me, back up off me
Back up off me, back up off me

Yah yah bitch, back up off me
You don't know me, I'm too clean, I'm too holy, bitch I'm godly
I only go for real niggas who don't brag bout what they bought me
'Cause they know I got a bag, gotta fuck me up some commas
If I fuck and make you cum, you got to promise not to stress me
Don't be blowing up my phone and don't be leaving voice messages
Said I can do you right, I'll do you better than your exes
I told that nigga to stop it, he was talking out his necklace
See the difference with me, I never needed niggas, ever
I'll leave 'em where I met em, I ain't tripping off no, ever
Goons in the cut try to talk you out your necklace
If you ever disrespect me, pussy, don't be disrespectful
I said woo, I said I know, I know, I know
He heard about me, he was waiting on me at the door
I said woo, yeah that mink all on the floor
Used to bust his shit at skating, 6 to 9, come in at 4
We got glow sticks for you ho chicks, bitch don't act like you don't know this
I'm very antisocial, social network ain't my motion (I don't move like that)
I sure know emotions, niggas, bitches is disgusting
Bananas with the Trojans, pop that pussy for a legend

I said woo, I said I know, I know, I know
I said bitch back up off me
I said woo, I said bitch back up off me
I said woo... get this nigga man
I said whoa, yah yah, bitch back up off me
I said whoa whoa, yah yah, bitch back up off me
I said whoa whoa, yah yah, bitch back up off me
I said whoa whoa, yah yah, bitch back up off me
Back up off me, back up off me, I said bitch back up off me
Back up off me, back up off me, I said bitch back up off me
Back up off me, back up off me, I said bitch back up off me
I said... back up off me, I said bitch back up off me

Back up off me, they want my backs in coffins
Gets so cold in the D and they still wanna take my jacket off me
Back when I couldn't afford to get it mixed and mastered, homie
My mama fronted me that money so it's no backup, homie
Bitch so back up off me
Bank account look like a ballot, homie, yeah it's checked up
My niggas packing, you get to tripping, they unpacking, homie
Yeah I overdo it, yeah that's tailored, homie
Yeah I'm overdressed and ain't no salad on me
Me and DeJ together, holy matrimony
Oh, it's hard to smile and shit
When they ain't free Juan, I got real ones on trial and shit
Fuck all my peers unless we talking bout Belle Isle and shit
The check is seven figures, I might try and dial the shit
And if I fuck and make you cum, don't be blowing up my phone
Lately I've been messing with girls who tend to own shit on their own
I turn dusk into dawn, turn my chair to a throne
Fuck her off in the whip, make her take Uber home
Cold to the chromosome, I grew up without a hammock
I did everything except panic, feel me? Finally Famous the family
And we expanding on the top floor like we tanning
She throwing tantrums
She gon hold this dick like a Grammy
I give her bomb D and do damage

I said woo, I said I know, I know, I know
I said bitch back up off me
I said woo, I said bitch back up off me
I said woo... get this nigga man
I said whoa, yah yah, bitch back up off me
I said whoa whoa, yah yah, bitch back up off me
I said whoa whoa, yah yah, bitch back up off me
I said whoa whoa, yah yah, bitch back up off me
Back up off me, back up off me, I said bitch back up off me
Back up off me, back up off me, I said bitch back up off me
Back up off me, back up off me, I said bitch back up off me
I said... back up off me, I said bitch back up off me

Yeah that's right mane
