Ooh! x16
Hey, I know it hurts to watch me leave
But say it ain't so, how could you ever replace me?
You're so shy when you wanna be standing in front of me
Mind spinning in circles, you're waiting to speak
These hands here in front of me anxiously wait to see
How's it gonna be.

Before I go, oh-oh-oh-oh!
Let me remind you what you're waiting for
Before you go, oh-oh-oh-oh!
Could you love me just a little bit more?
One more time.

Ooh! x8
Hey, hey darling, it's so damn hard to say goodbye
You know I'll try my hardest, I'll never change who I am inside
Try so hard and its gotta be standing in front of me
Clothes on the floor, and your eyes are on me
Tonight's all we got, keep your arms right here were it should be
Keep 'em wrapped around me.

Oh! x4
Let me remind you what you're waiting for
Before you go, oh-oh-oh-oh!
Could you love me just a little bit more?

Say baby don't go, go, go,
I don't think I'm finished with you yet
Baby don't go, go, go,
I'll never be finished with you, no-no-no.

Don't go now, baby,
Don't let me fall asleep alone
She said, 'Oh no no, baby'
I can't do this on my own.

Before I go, oh-oh-oh-oh!
Let me remind you what you're waiting for
Before you go, oh oh oh oh
Could you love me just a little bit more?
One more time.

I'll never leave too long
I wanna make it clear
And if you wait for me
I'll always keep you here.

Oh-oh-oh-oh!
Let me remind you what you're waiting for
Before you go, oh oh oh oh
Could you love me just a little, love me just a little bit more?
Love me just a little, love me just a little bit more?
