Break through the under toe
Your hands I can't seem to find
Pollution burns my tongue
Deaf words I can't speak so I stop my struggling

So I float to the surface
Fill my lungs with air
Then let it out

I give it all
Now there's a reason why I sing
So give it all
And it's these reasons that belong to me

Rock bottoms where we live
And still we dig these trenches
To bury ourselves in them 
Backs breaking under tension

For far too long these voices
Muffled by distances
And it's time to come to our senses
Up from the dirt

We give it all
Now there's a reason why I sing
So give it all
And it's these reasons that belong to me

Breathe (Breathe)
The air we give (give)
The life we live (live)
Our pulses racing distances

(Breathe)
So wet my tongue (give)
Break into song (live)
Through seas of competition

So please believe your eyes
A sacrifice is not what we had in our minds
I'm coming home tonight, home tonight

We give it all
Now there's a reason why I sing
So give it all
And it's these reasons that belong to me

Today I offer up myself to this
I'm living for my dying wish
I give it all, now there's a reason
There's a reason, to give it all
