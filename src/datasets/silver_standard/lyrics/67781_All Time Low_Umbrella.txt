You had my heart and we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines, but you'll still be my star
Baby cause in the dark, you can see shiny cars
That's when you need me there
With you I'll always share, because

When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out 'till the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Told you we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella

Under my umbrella
Under my umbrella
Under my umbrella

These fancy things will never come in between
You are my entity, here for infinity
When the war has took it's part
When the world has dealt it's cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart, because 

When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out 'till the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Told you we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella

Under my umbrella
Under my umbrella
Under my umbrella

You can run into my arms
That's okay, don't be alarmed
Come into me (There's no distance in between our love)
Gonna let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more, because

When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out 'till the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Told you we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella

Under my umbrella
Under my umbrella
Under my umbrella

It's raining
Oh baby, it's raining
Baby, come into me
Come into me
It's raining
Oh baby, it's raining
Oh baby, come into me
Come into me
