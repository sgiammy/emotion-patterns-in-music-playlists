Love, comes close to you
Your love, it makes me stronger
No matter what we're going through
I won't look back, won't look, won't look back
I won't look back, won't look, won't look back

You make me wanna live forever
You're my remedy to yesterday
Now my struggle seems so far away
And life will never be the same

Living it up, living it up, living it up
Life ain't a party, you are dancing by my side, yeah
Living it up, living it up, living it up
Life ain't a party, you are dancing by my side

Love, comes close to you
Your love, it makes me stronger
No matter what we're going through
I won't look back, won't look, won't look back
I won't look back, won't look, won't look back

I wish love was always this easy
But every now and then it brings us down
But I know that I can count on you
To keep the music playing on, no

Living it up, living it up, living it up
Life ain't a party, you are dancing by my side, yeah
Living it up, living it up, living it up
Life ain't a party, you are dancing by my side

Love, comes close to you
Your love, it makes me stronger
No matter what we're going through
I won't look back, won't look, won't look back
I won't look back, won't look, won't look back
