Right under my feet, there's air made of bricks
Pulls me down, turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune 
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
And I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time 
Without me knowing 
They melt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head 
But instead I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again 
Without me knowing
You've burnt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Why do you steal my hand
Whenever I'm standing my own ground?
You build me up, then leave me dead

Well, I hear your words you made up
So I say your name like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love
