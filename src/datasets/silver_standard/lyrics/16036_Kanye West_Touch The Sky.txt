I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'mma touch the sky
Gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'mma touch the sky

Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop, the doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boy's street team, I couldn't work the LOX
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-meant
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line, I just wanted to dance
I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line, "Dawg, in due time"
Now he look at me, like, "Damn, dawg, you where I am"
A hip hop legend, I think I died
In that accident, 'cause this must be heaven

I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'm a touch the sky
Gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'mma touch the sky

Now let's take 'em high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh la la la la la la la
(Top of the world, baby, top top of the world)
(Top of the world, baby, on top of the world)
Now let's take 'em high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh la la la la la la la
(Top of the world, baby, top top of the world)
(Top of the world, baby, on top of the world) Uh

Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats, me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was having nervous breakdowns like, "Man, these niggas that much better than me?"
Baby, I'm going on an aeroplane and I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets but when she came to kick it, things became different
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm trying to right my wrongs but it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song, now

I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gonna touch the sky
You gonna touch the sky baby girl
Testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gonna touch the sky

Lupe Fiasco:
Yes, yes, yes
Guess who's on third?
Lupe steal like Lupin the 3rd
Here like ear till I'm beer on the curb
Peach fuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth
But, before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm laying on the street
I'm trying to stop lion like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lyin' when I'm laying on the beat
En garde, or touch√©, Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel possessed as a gun charge
Come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
So, I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are like uh

Kanye West:
I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gonna touch the sky
You gonna touch the sky baby girl
Testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gonna touch the sky

We back at home, baby
Sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
Sky, uh, sky high
I'm, I'm sky high

Yeah
Keep it rollin'
Yeah
Uh, feels good to be home, baby
Feels good to be home
