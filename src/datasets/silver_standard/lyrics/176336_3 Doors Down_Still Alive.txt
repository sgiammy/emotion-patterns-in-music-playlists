Well I don't show feelings
I don't share them well
But I own scars that show
And they've got a story to tell

I bite my lip and walk away
And I know what I should say
There's so much on my mind
But you don't want to hear it

If you could see me on the other side
You might find me fighting for my life
But I'm still alive

This little high we're on
It ain't for the weak at heart
We've got a role to play
And I'm gonna play my part

I felt the soul, it burns
I've held it in my hands
And I feel it all the way
'Cause I never could kill it

If you could see me on the other side
You might find me fighting for my life
But I'm still alive

If you could see me on the other side
You might find me fighting for my life
But I'm still alive
