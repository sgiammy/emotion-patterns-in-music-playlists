...Kill the lights!

Hello ladies and gentleman
I'm glad you've graced me with your presence
You're in time to see me wrestle with my conscience
And staring in the si-si-si-silence

You see I came to save the stage
I hope I'm not too late
Passion called from back behind the curtain screaming
"Sonny this is urgent"

Fill these 50 persons with a purpose
But don't just give it away
Inspiration isn't cheap these days
You better make them earn it

You better make them earn it, make them earn it!
You better make them earn it, make them earn it!
