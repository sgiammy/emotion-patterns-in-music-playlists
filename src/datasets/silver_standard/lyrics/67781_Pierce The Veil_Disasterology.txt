I laid down, I drank the poison then I passed the fuck out.
Now let me tell you about the good life.
I have a million different kinds of fun.
When I'm asleep and in a dream that I'm your only one.

Can we create something beautiful and destroy it,
Nobody knows I dream about it.
This is my imagination.

If you come over tonight, we can travel through time.
We can sleep on the ceiling and creep under black lights.
I have a million different girls that hide under my bed.
And when I let them out they treat me right.
Oh, what a waste of a perfectly good clean wrist.
You were screaming till the police came.

Can we create something beautiful and destroy it,
Nobody knows I dream about it.
This is my imagination.
If every living thing dies alone.
What am I doing here?
Every living thing dies alone.
What am I doing here?

(Fuck it)

If it's the end of the world!
If it's the end of the world!
You and me, Should spend the rest of it in love!

Can we create something beautiful and destroy it,
Nobody knows I dream about it.
This is my imagination.
If every living thing dies alone.
What am I doing here?
If every living thing dies alone.
What am I doing here?
What am I doing here?
Oh, no.
