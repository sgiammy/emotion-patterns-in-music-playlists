(One, one, one)

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)

My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again

Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
And if you're under him
You ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

I keep pushin' forwards but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way, nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
(I never learn, I never learn)

But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again

Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
And if you're under him
You ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

Practice makes perfect, I'm still tryna learn it by heart
(I got new rules, I count 'em)
Eat, sleep and breathe it, rehearse and repeat it 'cause I
(I got new, I got new, I got new)

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again

Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
And if you're under him
You ain't gettin' over him

I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself
I've got new rules, I count 'em
(Baby, you know I count 'em)
I've gotta tell them to myself

Don't let him in, don't let him in
(Don't, don't, don't, don't)
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
(Don't, don't, don't, don't)
Don't let him in, don't let him in
(Don't, don't, don't, don't)
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
(Don't, don't, don't, don't)

You're gettin' over him
