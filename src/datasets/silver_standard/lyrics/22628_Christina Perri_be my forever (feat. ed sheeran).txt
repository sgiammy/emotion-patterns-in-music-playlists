We're on top of the world
We're on top of the world
Now darling, so don't let go
Can I call you are mine?
So, can I call you are mine?
Now darling, for a whole lifetime
My heart finally trusts my mind
And I know somehow it's right

In all, we got time, yeah
So darling, just say you'll stay
Right by my side
In all, we got love, yeah
So darling, just swear you'll stand
Right by my side

We're on top of the world
We're on top of the world
Now darling, so don't let go, mm

You're perfect in every way
I'm gonna shout it out
I wanna tell you now
'Cause I know somehow it's right

In all, we got time, yeah
So darling, just swear you'll stay
Right by my side
In all, we got love, yeah
So darling, just swear you'll stand
Right by my side

Be my forever, be my forever
Be my forever
Be my forever, be my forever

You're my bright blue sky
You're the sun in my eyes, oh
Baby, you're my life
You're the reason why

We're on top of the world
