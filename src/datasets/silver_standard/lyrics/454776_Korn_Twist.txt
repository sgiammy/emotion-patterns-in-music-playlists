You're not the right one dumb damn rapper
Not the right goddamn
Who are you to rap shit take off
And who says you're right
On top you think you're bomb artista
But you're bent out of ooh right
Suck my dick
But don't you think that you're ooh right
Sometimes things might make me ooh ooh
It makes me mad
And when it happens fuck it
Rugged in mind a hint by bite
Why does it not exist in you?
Right, shit,
Why hit in yet another day
Woo hoo right
It's not woo hoo right
But you're wrong

Twist

Twist
Twist

Put me in right now make me mad
Prove that your right
Somehow you're not right, huh
But that doesn't make me mad
Right now you're begging for a little brew
All night
Yeah it's so simple
I had some Red Dog,
You hand it over
