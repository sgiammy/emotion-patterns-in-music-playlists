Have you ever been to Mexico?
I wanna leave right now
Not a soul has to know the why or how
I wanna feel the tequila sunshine on my face
I wanna see that bikini tan as we stay up late

Let's be birds
Where you wanna go, just say the word
Let's be birds
Let's see if this is real love
Let's be birds
Let's be birds
What's the point of living in a beautiful world that you'll never see?
Come fly with me

I wanna taste the cinnamon in Istanbul
Sit on top of the Eiffel Tower that would be so cool
Let's go to Tokyo, it's on our way to Singapore
To wind up drinking hot chocolate on the Soho floor

Let's be birds
Where you wanna go, just say the word
Let's be birds
Let's see if this is real love
Let's be birds
Let's be birds
What's the point of living in a beautiful world that you'll never see?
Come fly with me

There's a whole universe that's waiting out there
What's the point of wings if you never go anywhere?
I never wanna look at you and think of where we could've gone
And all that we should've done
So put your hands up

Let's be birds
Where you wanna go, just say the word
Let's be birds
Let's see if this is real love
Let's be birds
Let's be birds
What's the point of living in a beautiful world that you'll never see?
Come fly with me

Let's be birds
Where you wanna go, just say the word
Let's be birds
Let's see if this is real love
Let's be birds
Let's be birds
What's the point of living in a beautiful world that you'll never see?
Come fly with me
