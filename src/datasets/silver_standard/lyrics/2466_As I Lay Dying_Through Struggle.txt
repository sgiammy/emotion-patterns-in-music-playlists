Only through struggle have I found rest
With a piece of me taken away
I begin to understand
Hollow out this machine like chest
With its gears that turn to make me feel
And assembled thoughts that fade away

Only through struggle have I found rest
Only through struggle have I found rest

Remove from me
This deception that I called love
That I called love

With its gears that turn to make me feel
And assembled thoughts that fade away

Remove from me
This deception that I called love
That I called love

Only through struggle have I found rest
With a piece of me taken away
I begin to understand
I begin to understand
