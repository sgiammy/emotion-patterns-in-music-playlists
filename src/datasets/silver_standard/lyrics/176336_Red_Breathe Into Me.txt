This is how it feels when I
Ignore the words you spoke to me
This is where I lose myself
When I keep running away from you
This is who I am when
When I don't know myself anymore
This is what I choose when
It's all left up to me

Breathe your life into me, I can't feel you
I'm falling, falling faster
Breathe your life into me, I still need you
I'm falling, falling, breathe into me, breathe into me

This is how it looks when
I am standing on the edge
This is how I break apart
I finally hit the ground
This is how it hurts when I
Pretend I don't feel any pain
This is how I disappear
When I throw myself away

Breathe your life into me, I can't feel you
I'm falling, falling faster
Breathe your life into me, I still need you
I'm falling, falling, breathe into me

(Breathe into me, breathe into me, breathe into me)

Breathe your life into me, I can't feel you
I'm falling, falling faster
Breathe your life into me, I still need you
I'm falling, falling, breathe into me
Breathe your life into me, I'm falling, falling faster
Breathe your life into me 
Falling, falling, falling, falling
Breathe into me, breathe into me, breathe into me, breathe into me
