In this hole, that is me
The dead are rolling over
In this hole, thickening
Dirt shoveled over shoulders

I feel it in me, so overwhelmed
Oh, this pressure center, rising
My life overturned, unfair, the despair
All these scars keep ripping open

Peel me from the skin, tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?
Tear meat from the bone, tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy now?

In this hole, that is me
A life that's growing feeble
In this hole, so limiting
The sun has set, all darkens

Buried underneath, hands slip off the wheel
Internal pathway to contention

Peel me from the skin, tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?
Tear meat from the bone, tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy now?

(Are you) Happy?
(Are you) Happy?
Are you feeling happy?

In this hole, that is me
Left with a heart exhausted
What's my release?  What sets me free?
Do you pull me up just to push me down again?

Peel me from the skin, tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?
Tear meat from the bone, tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy now?

Peel me from the skin, tear me from the rind
Does it make you happy now?
Tear meat from the bone, tear me from myself
Are you feeling happy now?

Does it make you happy?
Are you feeling happy?
Are you fucking happy
Now that I'm lost, left with nothing?

Does it make you happy?
Are you feeling happy?
Are you fucking happy
Now that I'm lost, left with nothing?
