Freezing
Rests his head on a pillow made of concrete
Again
Oh, feeling
Maybe he'll see a little better set of days, ooh yeah

Oh, hand out
Faces that he sees time again ain't that familiar, ooh yeah
Oh, dark grin
He can't help, when he's happy looks insane

Even flow
Thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know
So he chases them away, yeah
Ooh, oh, someday yet
He'll begin his life again
Life again
Life again

Kneelin'
Looking through the paper though he doesn't know to read, ooh yeah
Oh, prayin'
Now to something that has never showed him anything

Oh, feeling
Understands the weather of the winter's on its way
Oh, ceilings
Few and far between all the legal halls of shame, yeah

Even flow
Thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know
So he chases them away, yeah
Ooh, oh, someday yet
He'll begin his life again
Oh, whispering hands
Gently lead him away
Him away
Him away
Yeah

Whoo
Ah, yeah
Fuck it up

Hey man, you got a dollar?
Come on, just some spare change, man, I know you got
Well, God bless you man, God bless you

Even flow
Thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know
So he chases them away, yeah
Ooh, ah, someday yet
He'll begin his life again, yeah
Oh, whispering hands
Gently lead him away
Him away
Him away
Yeah

Whoo
Uh huh, yeah
Yeah yeah, mama mama, yeah
