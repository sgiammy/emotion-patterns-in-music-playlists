(Andre 3000:)
So, I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Sayin' that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'd every girl that I'd see see round town and
I hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smiling
Wetness all around me, true, but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, makes no sense I know, crazy
Give up all this pussy cat that's in my lap no lookin' back
Spaceships don't come equipped with rearview mirrors
They dip as quick as they can
The atmosphere is now ripped
I'm so like a Pip, I'm glad its night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon high, jump the broom
Like a premie out the womb
My partner yellin' "Too soon! Don't do it! Reconsider!
Read some litera - ture on the subject
You sure? Fuck it
You know we got your back like chiroprac - tic
If that bitch do you dirty
We'll wipe her ass out as in detergent
Now hurry hurry, go on to the altar
I know you ain't a pimp but pimp remember what I taught ya
Keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Aye, keep your heart 3 stacks, keep your heart
Man, these girls is smart, 3 stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part
Play your part"

Sweet jones
My bitch a choosey lover, never fuck without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Trash like the fuck for 40 dollars in the club
Fucking up the game, bitch you gets no love
She be cross country givin' all that she got
A thousand a pop, I'm pullin Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the grey one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parking lot we turn heads
Some hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Your bitch chose me, you ain't a pimp you a fairy

Ooh ooh
I choose you girl

(Bun B:)

Baby you been rollin' solo, time to get down with the team
The grass is greener on that other side if you know what I mean
I'll show you shit you've never seen
The 7 wonders of the world
And I can make you the 8th if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl I don't mean my woman, that ain't my style
Need a real street stalker to walk a green mile
We pilin' up the paper on the dining room table
Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable
We rockin' precious sable, keep that chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back
I'm a million dollar mack that need a billion dollar bitch
Put my pimpin' in your life, watch your daddy get rich
Easy as A B C, simple as 1 2 3
Get down with UGK, Pimp C, B U N B
'Cause what's a hoe with no pimp, and what's a pimp with no hoes?
Don't be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryin' to get jones

Ooh ooh
I choose you girl

(Big Boi:)
Eni mini decisions with precision I pick
Or make my selection on who I choose to be with
Girl don't touch my protection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin is something I don't do, tippin for life? (Mmm mmm!)
That's like makin' it rain
Every month on schedule (mmmHhmm!) Let me tell you
Get your parasol umbrella 'cause it's gonna get wetter
Better prepare you for the see-saw pole
She supposed to spend it on that baby but we see she don't
(Chopped and Screwed)
Ask ask Paul McCartney, the lawyers couldn't stop me
Slaughter slaughter of them pockets, had to tie her to a rocket
Send her into outer space, I know he wish he could
'Cause he payin' 20K a day, that b**** is eating good
Like an infant on a double D titty just getting plump
'Cause he miscalculated the next to the last bump
(Chopped and Screwed)
Dump dump in the gut, walk it off from the giddy up
Better chose the right one or pick pick the kiddies up

Ooh ooh
I choose you girl

I, I choose you baby
