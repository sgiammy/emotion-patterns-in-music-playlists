Nobody pray for me
Even a day for me
Way (yeah, yeah)

Aye, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits
But now I'm countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives
In fact, I'm downin' this
D'uss√© with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts

Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my pay stub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris

A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk

My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know, bitch, be humble

(Hol' up, bitch) Sit down
(Hol' up lil' bitch, hol' up lil' bitch) Be humble
(Hol' up, bitch) Sit down
(Sit down, hol' up, lil' bitch)
Be humble (bitch)
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up) Bitch, sit down
Lil' bitch (hol' up, lil' bitch) Be humble
(Hol' up, bitch) Sit down
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up) Be humble
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, lil' bitch) Sit down
(Hol' up lil' bitch) Be humble
(Hol' up, bitch) Sit down
(Hol' up, sit down, lil' bitch)
(Sit down, lil' bitch, be humble)
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, lil' bitch) Bitch, sit down
(Hol' up, bitch) Be humble
(Hol' up, bitch) Sit down
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)

Who dat nigga thinkin' that he frontin' on man, man? (Man, man)
Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life

I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks

Aye, this shit way too crazy, aye, you do not amaze me
Aye, I blew cool from AC, aye, Obama just paged me
Aye, I don't fabricate it, aye, most of y'all be fakin'
Aye, I stay modest 'bout it, aye, she elaborate it, aye
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk

Aye, watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk
Aye, if I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol
Aye, I'm the realest nigga after all, bitch
Be humble

(Hol' up, bitch) Sit down
(Hol' up lil' bitch, hol' up lil' bitch) Be humble
(Hol' up, bitch) Sit down
(Sit down, hol' up, lil' bitch)
Be humble (bitch)
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up) Bitch, sit down
Lil' bitch (hol' up, lil' bitch) Be humble
(Hol' up, bitch) Sit down
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up) Be humble
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, lil' bitch) Sit down
(Hol' up lil' bitch) Be humble
(Hol' up, bitch) Sit down
(Hol' up, sit down, lil' bitch)
(Sit down, lil' bitch, be humble)
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, lil' bitch) Bitch, sit down
(Hol' up, bitch) Be humble
(Hol' up, bitch) Sit down
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)
