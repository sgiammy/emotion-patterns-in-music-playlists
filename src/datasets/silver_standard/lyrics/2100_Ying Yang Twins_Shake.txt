Up in the club
Fuck VIP
P to da I
I to da T
Ying to the Yang
Up in this thing
D to da roc
My Nigga Kaine
Up in the cut
Pouring it up
Rolling it up
Holding it up
Ant her ass swollen or what?
Yes sir yes sir
Oh we gonna take it back like thieves and foes
Nasty as I wanna be
That makes me too live for your crew
Ho get down get low
I'm crossin these mammas like tic tac toe
Lets ride lets go
Get loose get crunk get drunk get blown
That's right lets roll
MIA ATL fo sho'

That ho's fine but but but but this one's a killa
That ho's fine but but but but this one's a killa
That ho's fine but but but but this one's a killa

All the li'l mamas all around the world
Shake that ass if you a nasty girl
Back that ass up says juvenile
Show a nigga some tities like girls gone wild
Tear off this clip of clothes, I wanna see you in the nude
You can keep on your high heel shoes
So follow me down to yellow brick road
Where niggas go to see naked hoes
Shake that shit bitch
And be off in the club with a hard ass dick
Then drop like this bitch
If you wanna make the money shawty work that shit
Put a hump in your back
And lick it raw
Do a 3 point stance
Put you mess up yo ass
You must be on that Kanye work out plan
Like head shoulder knees hoes

Take 'em out in cruise
Take 'em out all dressed
Is the realest true niggas in the ATL
Yeah we break it down betta shake a booty hoe
And them hoes and the girl with the real tight clothes
One time for the gang with the ying yang twins
We already know we off the reel
Don't tolerate that talkin'
Bitch you can get the walkin'
Patrollers is where I'm groaking
The only way that we are talkin'
If your breath smells like mine
Girl don't give a fuck 'cause you fine
I diss 'em fo I kiss 'em
I pack 'em fo I stack 'em
So while we in the club betta get these girls
'Cause on the streets there ain't no action
