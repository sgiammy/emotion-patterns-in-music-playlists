Tally up those points for me
We're settling the score
After everything we've started
You're gonna keep begging me for more
Watch this.
Start this again!

Tally up those points for me
We're settling the score
After everything we've started
You're gonna keep begging me for more
You don't need to tell me all about
The person I have been
Keep believing that we've given up,
We're not giving in
I promise, this is personal.

Whoa oh! Look at what you've started here,
Whoa oh! No I just can't take it anymore,
Look at what you've started now,
Whoa oh! Right now, I hope this makes you nervous.

Tell me what were you thinking
When you kept calling us out
Or you thought we would sit quietly
And let you keep running your mouth
You don't need to tell me all about
I want original, we are keep believing that we're over with,
We'll prove ya.
Prove you wrong!

Whoa oh! Look at what you've started here,
Whoa oh! No I just can't take it anymore,
Look at what you've started now,
Whoa oh! Right now, I hope this makes you nervous.

I hope you know
You are what made us this time
I hope you know
We'll never fall out of line
I hope you know
We'll be the greatest this time
I hope that you remember!
Remember! x3

I hope you remember the last time we tried from the start!
You took things I needed, you took me apart!
Take me back!
Start this again!

Oh no, look at what you've started here
Whoa oh, no I just can't take it anymore
Look at what you've started here
Whoa oh, no I just can't take it anymore
Look at what you've started now
Whoa oh, right now, I hope that you know
Everything you started here
Whoa oh, right now, I hope this makes you nervous.
