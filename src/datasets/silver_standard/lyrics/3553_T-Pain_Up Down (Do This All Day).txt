I ain't even know it (even know it)
Even know it (Know it)
Till the girl hit the stage
Seen a nigga throw it (nigga throw it)
Th- throw it (throw it)
Throwing that ass for days
Booty going Up-Down
I ain't got no problem spending all of my money
Trying to see what's up now
I can do this all day like it ain't nothing

Black car, party in the back yard,
Shorty got the black bra showing (black bra showing)
Tatted up, ass fat enough
She a bad bitch and she already know it (Yeah she know it)
Yeah she know it, Yeah yeah she know it
She a bad bitch and she already know it (Yeah she know it)
Yeah she know it, Yeah yeah she know it
She gon' make me spend some money on it
Whole bank account and I'll blow it

Go do a show then
Bring some more in
Pockets bigger than a Samoan
I'm at the stage every time shorty go in
Shorty go in, shorty shorty go in
Booty hit the floor then,
Slow motion
I'm so gone off Patrone
I don't know how I'm getting home later on like

I ain't even know it (even know it)
Even know it (Know it)
Till the girl hit the stage
Seen a nigga throw it (nigga throw it)
Th- throw it (throw it)
Throwing that ass for days
Booty going Up-Down
I ain't got no problem spending all of my money
Trying to see what's up now
I can do this all day like it ain't nothing

Shorty thick, thicker than a snicker
Every time she do it it's for me and my niggas
And her friend do it with her
She don't even like girls but a stack will make her kiss her (Go on Kiss her)
Go on Kiss her, Go on Go on Kiss her (Go on Kiss her)
She don't even like girls but a stack will make her kiss her (Go on Kiss her)
Go on Kiss her, Go on Go on Kiss her (Go on Kiss her)
She keep fucking around I'll launch this missile
She make it drop then jiggle

Go do a show then
Bring some more in
Pockets bigger than a Samoan
I'm at the stage every time shorty go in
Shorty go in, shorty shorty go in
Booty hit the floor then,
Slow motion
I'm so gone off Patrone
I don't know how I'm getting home later on like

I ain't even know it (even know it)
Even know it (Know it)
Till the girl hit the stage
Seen a nigga throw it (nigga throw it)
Th- throw it (throw it)
Throwing that ass for days
Booty going Up-Down
I ain't got no problem spending all of my money
Trying to see what's up now
I can do this all day like it ain't nothing

Yeah, Shorty
And you know it
Look at how she throw it
If it get any bigger baby girl gon' have to tow it, tow it
Sitting on them M's like Floyd but
She lied to you if she said I paid for it
Nigga 99 broads, 99 broads
Panoramic view from the 99th floor
I'm like My Lord
When she down on all fours
Got a hood bitch with me,
She ain't scared of taking charge
Well I ain't buying a car
You ain't know what you saw
She adjusted her bra
And lightened up a cigar
They was riding me off
Now Unwind like a star
I just sit back and laugh the irony of it all
Let them bands go, let them bands go
Watch a nigga
Throw a grand or so
On that cameltoe
And be like 'Damn boy, why you cuffing that ho?'
The whole team smashed her and you ain't even know

I ain't even know it (even know it)
Even know it (Know it)
Till the girl hit the stage
Seen a nigga throw it (nigga throw it)
Th- throw it (throw it)
Throwing that ass for days
Booty going Up-Down
I ain't got no problem spending all of my money
Trying to see what's up now
I can do this all day like it ain't nothing

I ain't even know it (even know it)
Even know it (Know it)
Till the girl hit the stage
Seen a nigga throw it (nigga throw it)
Th- throw it (throw it)
Throwing that ass for days
Booty going Up-Down

Trying to see what's up now
I can do this all day like it ain't nothing
