The End Of The World

Worldwide genocide, it's our affliction
The remains of yesterday
Help us get away from the destruction of our world
Running for cover as the ghost walk as man
Running for cover as the world comes to an end
Will this be a new beginning, to another end?
Will we suffer, the dawn, the dawn of a new age?
The flesh of man lay to waste, no hope for human kind
Only remains of yesterday
Running for cover as the ghost walk as man
Running for cover as the world comes to an end
Will this be a new beginning, to another end?
Will we suffer, the dawn, the dawn of a new age?
Tell me why, we have survived. While they have suffered
We are the chosen ones and we will never falter
As the world begins to spin round and round
This is the end, this is the end, and this is the end
We are the new rulers of this world
This is the end we are the last ones left
We are the rulers of the new world
We are the last ones left
We are the new rulers of this world
We are the last ones left
This is the end; this is the end of world
This is the end; this is the end of world
This is the end
