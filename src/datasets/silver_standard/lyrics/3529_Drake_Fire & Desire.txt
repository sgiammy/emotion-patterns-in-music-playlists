Dedicate, I dedicate the world
Yeah, oh
I dedicate, I dedicate
I give you my fortune
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, dedicate, dedicate
I dedicate to you
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate, oh yeah
I dedicate, I dedicate to you

They throwin' dirt on my old name
Only gets worse when you know things
You don't see the perks of this whole thing
But you get real on a pill and I like it
You just like my sidekick, I just wanna wife
Fulfill all your desires
Keep you in the front, never in the back
And never on the side, yeah

You a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it

Look, you know I'm a rider, nothin' left to hide
Your other nigga tired
Talk about you like you'll never leave his side
But I don't really buy it
Me I'm movin' quiet, all the things we're tryin'
Let's just keep it private (don't say anything)
Tell me should I cut these other girls right out of my life?
'Cause we never decided
Tell me how you feel inside

You a real ass woman and I like it
Dedicate to you
I need you inspired, I need you excited
I don't wanna fight it

I figure out you, you figure out me
We both a different breed
I'm followin' your lead, I ask you what you need
You say "a guarantee"
I mean you say that like it's easy
You never believe me
Told you I got Zs for these other girls sleepin' on 'em
Girl I'm sleepy
Sometimes I'm so indecisive

But you a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it

I give you my all
I dedicate, I dedicate, whoa yeah
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, baby, dedicate
I dedicate to you
I dedicate, I dedicate
This song's for you
I dedicate, I dedicate
I give you my all
I give you my voice
This song's for you
