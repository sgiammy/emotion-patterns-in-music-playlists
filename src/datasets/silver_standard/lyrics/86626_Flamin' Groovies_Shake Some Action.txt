I will find a way
To get to you some day
Oh, but I, babe, I'm so afraid I'll fall, yeah
Now can't you hear me call?

Shake some action's what I need
To let me bust out at full speed
I'm sure that's all you need
To make it all right

It's taken me so long
To get where I belong
Oh, but, oh, please don't send me back that way, yeah
For I will make you pay

Shake some action's what I need
To let me bust out at full speed
I'm sure that's all you need
To make it all right

If you don't dig what I say
Then I will go away
And I won't come back this again, no
'Cause I don't need a friend

Shake some action's what I need
To let me bust out at full speed
I'm sure that's all you need
To make it all right
