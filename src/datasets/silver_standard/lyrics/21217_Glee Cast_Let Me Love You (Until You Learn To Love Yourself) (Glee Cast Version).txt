Artie:
Baby I just don't get it
Do you enjoy being hurt?
I know you smelled the perfume,
The make-up on his shirt

You don't believe his stories
You know that they're all lies
Mad as you are, you stick around
And I just don't know why

Sam, Puck, Kurt and Mike (Artie):
If I was ya' man (baby you)
Never worry 'bout (what I do)
I'd be coming home (back to you)

Artie:
Every night,
Doin' you right

Sam, Puck, Kurt and Mike (Artie):
You're the type of woman (deserves good thangs)
Fist full of diamonds (hand full of rings)
Baby you're a star (I just want to show you, you are)

Artie with Sam, Puck, Kurt and Mike:
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be

Artie:
Baby you should let me love you,
Love you,
Love you

Listen
Your true beauty's description
Looks so good that it hurts
You're a dime plus ninety-nine and it's a shame
Don't even know what you're worth
Everywhere you go they stop and stare
'Cause you're bad and it shows
From your head to your toes
Out of control,
Baby you know

Sam, Puck, Kurt and Mike (Artie):
If I was ya' man (baby you)
Never worry 'bout (what I do)
I'd be coming home (back to you)

Artie:
Every night doin' you right

Sam, Puck, Kurt and Mike (Artie):
You're the type of woman (deserves good thangs)
Fistful of diamonds (hand full of rings)
Baby you're a star (I just want to show you, you are)

Artie with Sam, Puck, Kurt and Mike:
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Ooh, baby good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be
Baby you should let me

Sam, Puck, Kurt and Mike (Artie):
You deserve better girl (you know you deserve better)
We should be together girl (baby)

Artie:
With me and you it's whatever girl,
Hey!
So can we make this thing ours?

Artie with Sam, Puck, Kurt and Mike:
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need

Sam, Puck, Kurt and Mike:
