Ladies
I'm going to need you all to back away from the door
We are trying to make way for Chris Brown
Ladies
You are not listening
I'm going to need you all to back away from the door
We are trying to make way for Chris Brown
I'm Back
(Pull up, pull up) can't believe the girls, club packed
(What up, what up?) shawty wanna lead me to the back (to the back)
Ain't been in here 15 minutes, got a pocket full of digits
And she just won't take no
(Hold up, hold up) now little mama wanna get mad
(Slow up, slow up) saying she doesn't wanna share what she have (she have)
Ain't no particular one that's getting the water gun
So many that I want

They packed up in here wall to wall and
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall

Packed up in here wall to wall and
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall
Another two just came and said they love me on the radio
Two twins, that's a cool little scenario
They talking leaving right now
Wanna put in some time 'cause you know what they're already about
(One talking) about she like the way that I pop
(And the other one) said she wanna just watch
I'm game for any damn thang, but there's more than 200 dames
That's ready to go

They packed up in here wall to wall and
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall

Packed up in here wall to wall and
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling
I'm tryna give one of them all this

But they keep coming from wall to wall

(Chorus (spoken with ad libs))
They packed up in here wall to wall and
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall

Packed up in here wall to wall and
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall
So many look good in here
I don't even know which one I want
If I had to choose you all know
I would take all you all wit me
Who wanna try me on the floor
Who ready to come and get this
All I know I'm feeling this party
And you can see I'm so with it

(Chorus (with ad libs))
They packed up in here wall to wall and
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall

Packed up in here wall to wall and
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall

(Chorus (spoken with ad libs))
They packed up in here wall to wall and
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall

Packed up in here wall to wall and
I don't hear nothing but ladies calling
I'm tryna give one of them all this
But they keep coming from wall to wall
Yeah smash on the radio, bet I penned it
Yeah smash on the radio, bet I penned it
Yeah smash on the radio, bet I penned it
Yeah smash on the radio, bet I penned it
