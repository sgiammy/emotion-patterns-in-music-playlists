Stone cold
Stone cold
You see me standing
But I'm dyin' on the floor

Stone cold
Stone cold
Maybe if I don't cry
I won't feel anymore

Stone cold
Baby
God knows I try to feel

Happy for you
Know that I am
Even if I can't understand

I'll take the pain
Give me the truth
Me and my heart
We'll make it through

If happy is her
I'm happy for you

Stone cold
Stone cold
You're dancing with her
While I'm staring at my phone

Stone cold
Stone cold
I was your amber
But now she's your shade of gold

Stone cold
Baby
God knows I try to feel

Happy for you
Know that I am
Even if I can't understand

I'll take the pain
Give me the truth
Me and my heart
We'll make it through

If happy is her
I'm happy for you

Don't wanna be stone cold
Stone

I wish I could mean this but here's my goodbye

I'm happy for you
Know that I am
Even if I can't understand

If happy is her
If happy is her
I'm happy for you
