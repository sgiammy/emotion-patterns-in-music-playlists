You've been by my side
In every way
I know that you will not for sake me
I'll give you my life
I would not think twice
Your love is all I need, believe me

I may not say it quite as much as I should
When I say I love you
Darlin', that means for good
So open up you heart and let me in

And I will love you until forever
Until death do us part we'll be together
So take my hand
And hold on tight
And we'll get there
And this I swear

I'm wondering how I ever got by
Without you in my life to guide me
Where ever I go the one thing that's true
Is everything I do I do for you

I may not say it quite as much as I should
When I say I love you darling that means for good
So open up your heart and let me in
And I will love you till forever
Until death do us part we'll be together
So take my hand and hold on tight
And we'll get there
This I swear

So whenever you get there
Just reach out for me
I'll never let you down my love

And I will love you till forever
Until death do us part we'll be together
So take my hand and hold on tight
And we'll get there

And I will love you Until forever
Until death do us part we'll be together
So take my hand
And hold on tight
And we'll get there
Ooh, we'll get there
And this I swear
