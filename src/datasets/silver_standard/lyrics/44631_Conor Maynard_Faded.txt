You were the shadow to my light
Did you see us?
Another star, you fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us, alive

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Was it all in my fantasy?
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?

Where are you now?
Atlantis
Under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now?
Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me

I'm faded
I'm faded
I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost

Where are you now?
Atlantis
Under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now?
Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me

I'm faded
I'm faded
Yeah yeah

Faded, faded
I'm so faded, faded
I'm so faded, faded
Faded
Faded
Faded
