Word around town I'm the man nigga
Break that bitch down to the grams nigga
16 O's in a pound nigga, quarter back drop, touch down nigga

Touch, touch, touchdown nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown nigga
N-next day air, no ground nigga

Took a loss, had a nigga on slim fast
Now I'm moving weight like gym class
Broke her down every bag like Sinbad
How I get this bread mind your bizness
Set it on sight, and I go half price
Dough got my bread on your head no lights
Wrap it up good no smell, that's right
Cut the box open, no Jordan that's flight
Shit look good, so I'm stacking numbers
Next morning another tracking number
Looking for a bad bitch I can bust down
Tricking off field go I need a touchdown

Word around town I'm the man nigga
Break that bitch down to the grams nigga
16 O's in a pound nigga, quarter back drop, touch down nigga

Touch, touch, touchdown nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown nigga
N-next day air, no ground nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown nigga
N-next day air, no ground nigga

Throw that shit like Peyton
Throw that shit like Peyton
Throw that shit like Peyton
Hurry up, I got these other niggas waiting
Send, send the shit over trying to see bread
And if I say how I said it, I'ma see face
Ain't trying get myself cold nigga
When I throw the passes, it's colt nigga
Met a bitch at the club, I'm trying see her
She could be my new wide receiver
No photo, we don't play text
No smell wrapped up like safe sex
Fast life no slow down nigga
Move weight like my car broke down nigga
No rare thang good, no doubt
Long as niggas don't run the wrong routes

Word around town I'm the man nigga
Break that bitch down to the grams nigga
16 O's in a pound nigga, quarter back drop, touch down nigga

Touch, touch, touchdown nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown nigga
N-next day air, no ground nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown nigga
Touch, touch, touchdown nigga
N-next day air, no ground nigga

Throw that shit like Peyton
Throw that shit like Peyton
Throw that shit like Peyton
Hurry up, I got these other niggas waiting
