Bring it
Whoo!
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Ha ha, ha ha
What? What? What? What?
Uh

On your mark, ready, set, let's go
Dance floor pro, I know, you know
I go psycho when my new joint hit
Just can't sit
Got to get jiggy wit it
Uh that's it

Now honey, honey come ride
DKNY all up in my eye
You got a Prada bag with a lot of stuff in it
Give it to your friend, let's spin

Everybody looking at me
Glancing the kid
Wishing they was dancing a jig
Here with this handsome kid
Ciga-cigar right from Cuba-cuba
I just bite it
It's for the look, I don't light it

Ill-Way, the an-may on the ance-day oor-flay
Giving up jiggy make it feel like foreplay
Yo, my cardio its infinite
Ha ha
Big Willie Style's all in it
Gettin' jiggy wit it

(Nana na na nana na, nana na na nana)
Gettin' jiggy wit it
(Nana na na nana na, nana na na nana)
Gettin' jiggy wit it
(Nana na na nana na, nana na na nana)
Gettin' jiggy wit it
(Nana na na nana na, nana na na nana)

What you want to ball with the kid
Watch your step you might fall
Trying to do what I did
Mama-uh mama-uh mama come closer
In the middle of the club with the rub-a-dub, unh

No love for the haters, the haters
Mad, 'cause I got floor seats at the Lakers
See me on the fifty yard line with the Raiders
Met Ali, he told me I'm the greatest

I got the fever for the flavour of a crowd pleaser
DJ play another
From the prince of this show, Your Highness
Only mad chicks ride in my whips
South to the west to the east to the north
Bought my hits and watch 'em go off a go off
Ah yes yes y'all and you don't stop
In the winter or the (summertime)
I makes it hot
Gettin' jiggy wit 'em

(Nana na na nana na, nana na na nana)
Gettin' jiggy wit it
(Nana na na nana na, nana na na nana)
Gettin' jiggy wit it
(Nana na na nana na, nana na na nana)
Gettin' jiggy wit it
(Nana na na nana na, nana na na nana)

Eight-fifty I.S. if you need a lift
Who's the kid in the drop?
Who else? Will Smith
Living that life some consider a myth
Rock from South Street to one two fifth

Women used to tease me
Give it to me now nice and easy
Since I moved up like George and Wheezy
Cream to the maximum I be asking 'em
Would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum?

Never see Will attacking 'em
Rather play ball with Shaq and 'em, flatten 'em
Psyche, kidding you thought I took a spill
But I didn't
Trust the lady of my life she hitting
Hit her with a drop top with the ribbon
Crib for my mom on the outskirts of Philly
You trying to flex on me? Don't be silly
Gettin' jiggy wit it

(Nana na na nana na, nana na na nana)
Gettin' jiggy wit it
(Nana na na nana na, nana na na nana)
Gettin' jiggy wit it
(Nana na na nana na, nana na na nana)
Gettin' jiggy wit it
(Nana na na nana na, nana na na nana)

(Nana na na nana)
(Nana na na nana)

(Nana na na nana na, nana na na nana)
(Nana na na nana na, nana na na nana)
(Nana na na nana na, nana na na nana)
(Nana na na nana na, nana na na nana)
