No-nah-nah
Yeah-yeah
No-nah-nah
Yeah

My mama called, seen you on TV
Said some shit done changed
Ever since we was on
I dreamed it all
Ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say congratulations
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation
They ain't never had the dedication
People hatin', say we changed and look we made it
Yeah, we made it

They was never friendly
Now I'm jumping out the Bentley
And I know I sound dramatic, yeah
But I know I had to have it, yeah
For the money I'm a savage, yeah
I be itching like I had it, yeah
I'm surrounded 20 bad bitches
But they didn't know me last year, yeah
Everyone wanna act like they important, yeah-yeah-yeah
But all that mean nothing when I saw my dog, yeah-yeah-yeah
Everyone counting on me, drop the ball, yeah-yeah-yeah
Everything costing like I'm at the bottom, yeah-yeah
If you fuck with winning, put your lighters to the sky
How could I make sense when I got millions on my mind
Coming with that bullshit, I just put it to the side
Balling since a baby they could see it in my eyes

My mama called, seen you on TV
Said some shit done changed

I dreamed it all
Ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say congratulations
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation
They ain't never had the dedication
People hatin', say we changed and look we made it
Yeah, we made it

I was patient, yeah-oh
I was patient, ay-oh
Now I can scream that we made it
Now everywhere-everywhere I go they say 'gratulations
Young nigga, young nigga, graduation
I pick up the rock and I ball, baby
I'm looking for someone to call, baby
But right now I got a situation
Nothing but old Ben-Ben Franklins
Big rings, champagne
My life is like a ball game
But instead I'm in the trap though
Pot so big, call it Super Bowl
Super Bowl, call the hoes, get in the Rolls
Top floor lifestyle, Honcho and Post
Malone, I got a play on my phone, ay
You know what I'm on
Huncho Houdini is gone, ay
