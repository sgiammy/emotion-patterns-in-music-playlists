Yeah, I had your love right here
In the palm of my hands
And I lost it and I lost it
Had a love so new, one a man feel
And I lost it and I lost it

Maybe if I had spent more time with you
Maybe then, maybe then you'd still be mine
Oh and only if I had been just a little more kind to you
There'd be no need, for this man to be cryin'

The whole town's laughing at me
Silly fool, how'd you lose such a good friend?

Had my dream so near
I could reach out and touch it
And I lost it and I lost it
Had a world complete
It was, oh, so sweet
And I lost it and I lost it

Maybe if I had spent just a little more time with you
Maybe then, maybe then you still be mine
Oh and only if I had been just a little more kind to you
There'd be no need, for this man to be cryin'

The whole town's laughing at me
Silly fool, how'd you lose such a good friend? Oh

Maybe if I had spent more time with you
Maybe then, maybe then you still be mine
Maybe I think about it
And only if I had been just a little more kind to you
There'd be no need, for this man to be cryin'

The whole town's laughing at me
Silly fool, how'd you lose such a good friend?
The whole town's laughing at me
Silly fool, how'd you lose such a good friend?
The whole town's laughing at me
Silly fool, how'd you lose such a good friend?
