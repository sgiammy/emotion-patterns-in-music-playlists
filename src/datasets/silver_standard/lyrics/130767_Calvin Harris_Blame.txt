Can't be sleeping
Keep on waking
[Original version:]Without the woman next to me
[Altered version:]Is that the woman next to me?
Guilt is burning
Inside I'm hurting
This ain't a feeling I can't keep

So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me

Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me

Can't you see it?
I was manipulated by it
Too little to the dawn
I had no choice in this
I was a friend she missed
She needed me to talk

So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me

Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me

Oh I'm so sorry, so sorry baby
Yeah
I got defense
Oh I promise (I'll be better this time, I will be better this time)

Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
