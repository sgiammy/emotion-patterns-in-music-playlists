He seemed impressed by the way you came in
"Tell us a story, I know you're not boring"
I was afraid that you would not insist
"You sound so sleepy, just take this, now leave me"

I said please don't slow me down if I'm going too fast
Oh, you're in a strange part of our town

Yeah, the night's not over
You're not trying hard enough
Our lives are changing lanes
You ran me off the road
The wait is over
I'm now taking over
You're no longer laughing
I'm not drowning fast enough

Now every time that I look at myself
"I thought I told you, this world is not for you"
The room is on fire as she's fixing her hair
"You sound so angry, just calm down, you found me"

I said please don't slow me down if I'm going too fast
You're in a strange part of our town

Yeah, the night's not over
You're not trying hard enough
Our lives are changing lanes
You ran me off the road
The wait is over
I'm now taking over
You're no longer laughing
I'm not drowning fast enough
