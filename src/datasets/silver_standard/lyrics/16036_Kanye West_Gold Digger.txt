She take my money when I'm in need
Yeah she's a triflin' friend indeed
Oh, she's a gold digger, way over town
That digs on me

(She gives me money)
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need)
But she ain't messin' wit' no broke niggas

(She gives me money)
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need)
But she ain't messin' wit' no broke niggas

(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head get down

(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said, I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls you got a flock, I can tell by your charm

And your arm, but I'm lookin' for the one. Have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have an ass like Serena
Trina, Jeena-fah Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad ass to ShowBiz

Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl then you better be paid

You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

(She gives me money)
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, uh
(When I'm in need)
But she ain't messin' wit' no broke niggas, uh

(She gives me money)
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, uh
(When I'm in need)
But she ain't messin' wit' no broke niggas, uh

(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

Eighteen years, eighteen years
She got one of yo' kids, got you for eighteen years
I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his

You will see him on TV, any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor got lipo with your money

She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Should've got that insured, GEICO for your money (money...money)
If you ain't no punk
Holla we want prenup (We want prenup!)

Yeah, it's something that you need to have
'Cause when she leave your ass she gon' leave with half
Eighteen years, eighteen years
And on her eighteenth birthday, he found out it wasn't his

(She gives me money)
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, uh
(When I'm in need)
But she ain't messin' wit' no broke niggas, uh

(She gives me money)
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger, uh

(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head get down, uh
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

Now I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke but he can't buy weed
You got out to eat and he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves

But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it into a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries

So, stick by his side
I know there's dude's ballin', but yeah that's nice
And they gon' keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when you get on, he leave yo' ass for a white girl

(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

Let me hear that back....
