Diamonds really diamonds
And I'm shining bright 'cause I'm really grinding
They ask me if I'm real, I say "is you serious?"
My daughter gon' love this bitch here

All my diamonds shine 'cause they really diamonds
Bad bitches in line, they be really trying
They ask me if I'm high, I say "really really"
Got money on my mind, I say "really really"
I look like I been ballin' 'cause I'm really ballin'
I won't apologize, I'm not really sorry
They ask me if I'm lying, I say "really really"
I'm really out my mind, I say "really really"
Really really

Make 'em believe, I made 'em believe
A lyrical song writer and he can sing
Bringing in money like raking in leaves
I was just trying to get paper to sneeze
Achoo, that was a blessing
She special to you, I don't look at her special
Actually, I treat her regular
Not being seen, we not making no spectacle
Gates had her first then he gave her to Kevin
All the above we do all the et cetera
Scared of the feds, had to switch up my cellular
He talking reckless, don't call me back ever
Passing through Gardere to holler at Glover
Shout out to Black, shout out to Cedric
Grey Monte Carlo, cocaine 911
Just hollered at Trav, I'm like the Reverend
My section ridiculous, watch where you steppin'
Pockets on indigent, can't be too careful
Steve like 'em tall and when they yellow
Working in college, fresh with low mileage
I like 'em black, pretty white teeth
Body unique, booty on fleek
Jhen√© Aiko, chewing her cheeks
Groceries, please, you know that was me

All my diamonds shine 'cause they really diamonds
Bad bitches in line, they be really trying
They ask me if I'm high, I say "really really"
Got money on my mind, I say "really really"
I look like I been ballin' 'cause I'm really ballin'
I won't apologize, I'm not really sorry
They ask me if I'm lying, I say "really really"
I'm really out my mind, I say "really really"
Really really

Diving be treacherous (Swim)
Pray to God that don't nobody mess with us (Him)
Keep it strong in case anyone testing us
Right or wrong, if it's this, you don't mess with it
When yo bitch over here I don't mess with her
No detective work, I don't be questioning
Where she been, trying to read all of her messages
I don't speak on no man that's irregular
Take her phone disconnectin' her cellular
What you need that for undressin' her?
What you need that for caressin' her?
Spreading her legs 'bout to pleasure her
Pulling her hair from the back, go to pressin' her
Trying to see who tap first, made a bet with her
Relationship flaking, no eczema
She catching feelings, she say we inseparable
Oyster Perpetual, it's not a replica
Mustang GT in the streets smoking vegetables
Trunk in the front, do it make me a elephant?
I really really put syrup in my beverages
Shopping in Beverly, check out my etiquette
Loving my swag, women tailor keep checking it
Carats they glisten in all of my necklaces
Feeling myself, really thought it was evident

All my diamonds shine 'cause they really diamonds
Bad bitches in line, they be really trying
They ask me if I'm high, I say "really really"
Got money on my mind, I say "really really"
I look like I been ballin' 'cause I'm really ballin'
I won't apologize, I'm not really sorry
They ask me if I'm lying, I say "really really"
I'm really out my mind, I say "really really"
Really really
