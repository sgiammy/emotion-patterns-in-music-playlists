Off with your head, dance 'til you're dead
Heads will roll, heads will roll, heads will roll on the floor

Glitter on the west streets, silver over everything
The river's all wet, you're all chrome
Dripping with alchemy, shiver stop shivering
The glitter's all wet, you're all chrome
The men cry out, the girls cry out
The men cry out, the girls cry out
The men cry out, oh no
The men cry out, the girls cry out
The men cry out, the girls cry out
The men cry out, oh no, oh, oh, oh, oh

Off-off with your head, dance-dance 'til you're dead dead
Heads will roll, heads will roll, heads will roll on the floor
Looking glass, take the past, shut your eyes, realize
Looking glass, take the past, shut your eyes, realize

Glitter on the west streets, silver over everything
The glitter's all wet, you're all chrome, you're all chrome, oh, oh, oh

Off-off-off with your head, dance-dance-dance 'til you're dead dead
Off-off-off with your head, dance-dance-dance 'til you're dead dead
Off-off-off with your head, dance-dance-dance 'til you're dead dead
Off-off-off with your head, dance-dance-dance 'til you're dead dead
Off-off-off with your head, dance-dance-dance 'til you're dead dead
Off-off-off with your head, dance-dance-dance 'til you're dead dead
