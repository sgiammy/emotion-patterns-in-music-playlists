And I came here to make you dance tonight
I don't care if I'm a guilty pleasure for you

And I don't even know
What kinda fool you're taking me for
So you've got some brand new clothes
You never could afford before

Oh brother, spare us all
We don't care anymore
We just wanna get down on the floor
You sell yourself to make it
You can dish it, but can you really take it?

You're never gonna get it with nothing
'Cause nothing's what you got in your head
So stop pretending

I came here to make you dance tonight
I don't care if I'm a guilty pleasure for you
Shut up, 'cause we won't stop
And we're getting down till the sun's coming up

I came here to make you dance tonight
I don't care if I'm a guilty pleasure for you
Shut up, 'cause we won't stop
And we're getting down till the sun's coming up

And I don't even read
What the papers gotta say about me
Oh no I can't believe
They take it so serious, seriously

I'm so bored, oh please don't talk anymore
Shut your mouth and get down on the floor
So cynical, poor baby
I can dish it 'cause I know how to take it

You're never gonna win 'em all
So 'em if they can't take a joke
I'm just playing

I came here to make you dance tonight
I don't care if I'm a guilty pleasure for you
