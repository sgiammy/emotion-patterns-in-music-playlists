Well, I've been watching
While you've been coughing
I've been drinking life
While you've been nauseous

And so I drink to health
While you kill yourself
And I've got just one thing
That I can offer

Go on and save yourself
And take it out on me
Go on and save yourself
And take it out on me, yeah

I'm not a martyr
I'm not a prophet
And I won't preach to you
But here's a caution

You better understand
That I won't hold your hand
But if it helps you mend
Then I won't stop it

Go on and save yourself
And take it out on me
Go on and save yourself
And take it out on me

Go on and save yourself
And take it out on me
Go on and save yourself
And take it out on me

Drown if you want
And I'll see you at the bottom
Where you'll crawl on my skin
And put the blame on me so you don't feel a thing

Go on and save yourself
And take it out on me
Go on and save yourself
And take it out on me

Go on and save yourself
And take it out on me
Go on and save yourself
And take it out on me, yeah
