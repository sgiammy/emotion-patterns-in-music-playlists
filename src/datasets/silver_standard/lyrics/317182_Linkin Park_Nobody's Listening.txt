Coming at you

Peep the style and the kids checking for it
The number one question is how could you ignore it
We drop right back in the cut over basement tracks 
With raps that got you backing this up like, rewind that
We're just rolling with the rhythm
Rise from the ashes of stylistic division
With these non-stop lyrics of life living
Not to be forgotten but still unforgiven
But in the meantime there are those
Who want to talk this and that so I suppose
That it gets to a point feelings got to get hurt
And get dirty with the people spreading the dirt, it goes

I try to give you warning, but everyone ignores me
Told you everything loud and clear, but nobody's listening
Call to you so clearly, but you don't want to hear me
Told you everything loud and clear, but nobody's listening

I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger held in my chest
And everything left's a waste of time
I hate my rhymes but hate everyone else's more
I'm riding on the back of this pressure
Guessing that its better I can't keep myself together
Because all of this stress gave me something to write on
The pain gave me something I could set my sights on
You never forget the blood, sweat, and tears
The uphill struggle over years, the fear and 
Trash talking and the people it was to
And the people that started it just like you

I try to give you warning but everyone ignores me
Told you everything loud and clear, but nobody's listening
Call to you so clearly but you don't want to hear me
Told you everything loud and clear, but nobody's listening

I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger held in my chest
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat and tears
Nothing to gain, everything to fear
I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger held in my chest
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat and tears
Nothing to gain, everything to fear
Heart full of pain, heart full of pain

I try to give you warning but everyone ignores me
Told you everything loud and clear, but nobody's listening
Call to you so clearly but you don't want to hear me
Told you everything loud and clear, but nobody's listening

I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Nobody's listening
Handful of anger held in my chest
Nobody's listening
Uphill struggle, blood, sweat and tears
Nobody's listening
Nothing to gain, everything to fear
Nobody's listening

Coming at you from every side
