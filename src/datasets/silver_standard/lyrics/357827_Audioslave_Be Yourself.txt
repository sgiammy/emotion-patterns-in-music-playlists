Someone falls to pieces, sleeping all alone
Someone kills the pain
Spinning in the silence
She finally drifts away

Someone gets excited in the chapel yard
And catches a bouquet
Another lays a dozen
White roses on a grave

And to be yourself is all that you can do, hey
To be yourself is all that you can do

Someone finds salvation in everyone
Another only pain
Someone tries to hide himself
Down inside himself he prays

Someone swears his true love until the end of time
Another runs away
Separate or united
Healthy or insane

And to be yourself is all that you can do, hey (all that you can do)
To be yourself is all that you can do (all that you can do)
To be yourself is all that you can do, hey (all that you can do)
To be yourself is all that you can do

Even when you've paid enough
Been pulled apart or been held up
Every single memory of
The good or bad faces of luck
Don't lose any sleep tonight
I'm sure everything will end up alright
You may win or lose

But to be yourself is all that you can do, yeah
To be yourself is all that you can do, oh

To be yourself is all that you can do, hey (all that you can do)
To be yourself is all that you can do (all that you can do)
To be yourself is all that you can
Be yourself is all that you can
Be yourself is all that you can do
