Oh, baby, yeah

Days in the sun
And nights in the rain
Summer is over, simple and plain
Found me some fun that's good for the pain
Already told you, I don't feel the same
I don't feel the same

Anywhere I go
I can't help but show
I don't feel the same
Anywhere I go
I can't help but know
I don't feel the same
Anywhere I go
I can't help but know
