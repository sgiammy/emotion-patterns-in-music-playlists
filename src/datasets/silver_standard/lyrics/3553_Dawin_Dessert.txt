Are you saving that dessert for me?
'Cause if you want baby
You know you could work for me
The way you do it causing jealousy

They try to do it like you (like you)
And they get mad 'cause they don't do it successfully
They try to copy your moves (your moves)
But they don't never ever do it that tastefully
