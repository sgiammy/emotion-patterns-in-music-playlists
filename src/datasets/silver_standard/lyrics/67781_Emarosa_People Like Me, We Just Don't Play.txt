I can feel you leaving
I can see you running out
It's faith
(Help me)
I can feel you leaving
It's a tale of what I don't have
The will to say
The filth that I became
So maybe reasons why
I'm losing you are the reasons I can't hide
But I can't stop running no

And I fall asleep in the safest places I can find
I'm losing religion because I can't find a god that's mine
And so it's back to the old me
Killing you slowly and I'm fine

I can feel you leaving
We're burning bridges down to the fire below
Time to let it go
No you won't
So maybe reasons why
I'm losing you are the reasons I can't hide
But I can't stop running no

And I fall asleep in the safest places I can find
I'm losing religion because I can't find a god that's mine
And so it's back to the old me
Killing you slowly and I'm fine

Show me something
Shake me from my haze
When I need your help
You never saw me coming no
Here in my personal hell
So maybe reasons why
I'm losing you are the reasons I can't hide
But I can't stop running no

And I fall asleep in the safest places I can find
I'm losing religion because I can't find a god that's mine
And so it's back to the old me
Killing you slowly and I'm fine
