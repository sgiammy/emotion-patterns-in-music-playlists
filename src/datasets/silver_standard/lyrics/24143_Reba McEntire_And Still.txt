Thousands of people
Live in this town
And I had to run into him
When I saw him there
On that busy street
Those feelings came back again

There was nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
He walked up to me
Looked in my eyes

And still
The world stood still
I couldn't move
And all I could feel
Was this aching in my heart
Saying I loved him
Still

He said how've you been
It's great to see you again
You're really a sight for sore eyes
I said I can't complain
Oh, I'm doin' fine
We talked
As the people rushed by

We laughed about old times
And all we went through
That's when he hugged me
And said I've missed you

And still
The world stood still
I couldn't move
And all I could feel
Was this aching in my heart
Saying I loved him
Still

That's when she walked up to him
He said this is my wife
I gave my best smile
But I was dying inside
He said we gotta go now
It's getting late
It was so good to see you
And then they walked away

And still
My world stood still
I couldn't move
And all I could feel
Was this aching in my heart
Saying I loved him...
Still
