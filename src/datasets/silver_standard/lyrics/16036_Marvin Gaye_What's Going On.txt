Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying
Brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today

Father, father
We don't need to escalate
You see, war is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today, oh (oh)

Picket lines (sister) and picket signs (sister)
Don't punish me (sister) with brutality (sister)
Talk to me (sister), so you can see (sister)

Oh, what's going on (what's going on)
What's going on (what's going on)
Yeah, what's going on (what's going on)
Oh, what's going on (what's going on)

Mother, mother
Everybody thinks we're wrong
Oh, but who are they to judge us
Simply 'cause our hair is long
Oh, you know we've got to find a way
To bring some understanding here today

Picket lines (brother) and picket signs (brother)
Don't punish me (brother) with brutality (brother)
Come on, talk to me (brother), so you can see (brother)

What's going on (what's going on)
Yeah, what's going on (what's going on)
Tell me what's going on (what's going on)
I'll tell you what's going on (what's going on)
