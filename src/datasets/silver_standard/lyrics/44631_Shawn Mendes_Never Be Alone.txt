I promise that one day I'll be around 
I'll keep you safe, I'll keep you sound 
Right now it's pretty crazy 
And I don't know how to stop or slow it down 

Hey I know there are some things 
We need to talk about 
And I can't stay 
So let me hold you for a little longer now 

Take a piece of my heart 
And make it all your own 
So when we are apart 
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone

You'll never be alone 
When you miss me close your eyes 
I may be far, but never gone 
When you fall asleep tonight, 
Just remember that we lay 
Under the same stars 

Hey I know there are some things 
We need to talk about 
And I can't stay 
So let me hold you for a little longer now 

Take a piece of my heart 
And make it all your own 
So when we are apart 
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone

You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone

Take a piece of my heart 
And make it all your own 
So when we are apart 
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
