I wanna go back, forget that it's over
Paint it in black
When you left me alone
I never knew
She was sleeping next door with the kid I grew up with
And I can't go back to her anymore no

You tell me you were happier with him
But you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
No I can't lift the weight

Put you in the past
Try to forget you 'cause it's over
And every time you ask
I'll pretend I'm okay
You're inside my head
In the middle of the night
When I don't feel right
I dream I can hold you
And I can't go back to you anymore
Yeah yeah

You tell me you were happier with him
But you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
But I can't lift the weight
And I can't lift the weight

And I can't lift the weight
No  I can't lift the weight
Yeah you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks
I can't lift the weight
No I can't lift the weight
Yeah you stand on my shoulders and my heart just breaks
I can't lift the weight
No I can't lift the weight
Yeah you lower your standards and I raise the stakes
Can't lift the weight
No I can't lift the weight

You tell me you were happier with him
But you want me to stay
And you tell me that you needed time but you, you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, my heavy heart just breaks
But I can't lift the weight
and I can't lift the weight

You tell me you were happier with him
But you want me to stay
And you told me that you needed time but you pushed me away
And when you try to take me back, you say someday you will change
But I don't want to wait
