Do you think I'll ever need you love more than you need me?
Show me your true colors girl, I just want to see
'Cause I done had too many come around and change on me
She screamin' please don't waste my time
I say I totally agree
See girl I'm fine with that
I done gave my watches away, ain't got no time for that
Askin' where's my heart, good luck findin' that
How long could I see her round still think I'm timin' that
Think I'm still timin' that

Pretty teeth with a nice demeanor
I'm in a rush, it was nice to meet ya
Collard shirt, no elongated T's, cheaper to be yourself
Ain't no wrong way to be, accomplished a lot
Came from the block, ambitious in the trenches
I got a long way to reach
Sorry if I was offensive, but not at all
You got to pardon me at times, okay problem solved
When I hear the word can't take it like a challenge
I don't understand why the hell I can't have it
Help me understand why the hell I can't have it
I was blessed with a swag and I ain't braggin'
Insecurities get covered with designer fashion
If I'm not intimidatin' tell me why you're bashful
If you not feelin' what I'm sayin', sorry for the hassle
But if you leavin' here with me it'll be fantastic

How long could I see her round think I'm still timin' that
Think I'm still timin' that

Ain't no relaxin', they pillow fightin' on the sofa
Not at all my main focus though I was hopin'
Pull your hair, kiss it soft while you bendin' over
After that we could shower and I could hold ya
Havin' deep conversation and now you open
Pretendin' that I was asleep while you on the phone
Listen to you tell your girlfriend how I stroke it
Only that it was a fool I already know it, mind blowin'
Phone rang bout to go, is you rollin'
Playin' poker no cards, throwin' hands exposin'
Rest in peace Soulja Slim, slow motion
Kicked out of everywhere, expulsion
