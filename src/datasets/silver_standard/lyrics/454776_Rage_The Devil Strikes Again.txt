Echoes of evil sound through my head,
I can't believe it 'cause I ought to be dead.
Head for disaster, I've done before.
Go back to my master, I just cannot ignore.
All of these years I have tried to resist,
Now I just see it will always exist ...
Hell, what a night,
Now the devil strikes again
Faster than light, back into my life.
Hell, what a night,
Now the devil strikes again
Faster than light, back into my life.
The devil will strike back again!
Out in the black night, back to the grave.
Focused on that sight I just live like a slave.
Ban it from my life, it's lying in wait.
Cursed from my dark side,
Now I know it's too late.
All of those years...
Hell, what a night ...
The devil will strike back,
It's blackening my mind once again!
