I saw you standing in the middle
Of the thunder and lightning
I know you're feeling like
You just can't win but you're trying

It's hard to keep on keeping on
When you're being pushed around
Don't even know which way is up
Just keep spinning down, 'round down

Every storm runs, runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away
Just like every storm runs, runs out of rain

So hold your head up and tell yourself
That there's something more
Walk out that door, go find a new rose
Don't be afraid of the thorns

'Cause we all have thorns
Just put your feet up to the edge
Put your face in the wind and when
You fall back down, keep on remembering

Every storm runs, runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away
Just like every storm runs, runs out of rain

It's gonna run out of pain
It's gonna run out of sting
It's gonna leave you alone
It's gonna set you free, set you free

Every storm runs, runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away
Just like every storm runs, runs out of rain

It's gonna set you free
It's gonna run out of pain
It's gonna set you free
