Ain't found a way to kill me yet
Eyes burn with stinging sweat
Seems every path leads me to nowhere, mmm
Wife and kids, household pet
Army green was no safe bet
The bullets scream to me from somewhere, mmm

Here they come to snuff the Rooster, oh yeah
Yeah here come the Rooster, yeah
You know he ain't gonna die
No, no, no oh, you know he ain't gonna die

Here they come to snuff the rooster, oh yeah
Yeah here come the rooster, yeah
You know he ain't gonna die, oh
No, no, no oh, you know he ain't gonna die

Walkin' tall machine-gun men
They spit on me in my homeland
Gloria sent me pictures of my boy, mmm
Got my pills 'gainst mosquito death
My buddy's breathing his dyin' breath
Oh God, please, won't you help me make it through?

Here they come to snuff the Rooster, oh yeah
Yeah, here come the Rooster, yeah
You know he ain't gonna die
No, no, no oh, you know he ain't gonna die
