Lying here with you so close to me
It’s hard to fight these feelings
When it feels so hard to breathe
I'm caught up in this moment
Caught up in your smile

I've never opened up to anyone
So hard to hold back
when I’m holding you in my arms
We don’t need to rush this
Let’s just take it slow

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
No I don’t want to mess this thing up
No I don’t want to push too far

Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I’ve been waiting for my whole life
So baby I’m alright with just a kiss goodnight

I know that if we give this a little time
It’ll only bring us closer to the love we wanna find
It’s never felt so real
No it’s never felt so right

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
No I don’t want to mess this thing up
I don’t want to push too far

Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I’ve been waiting for my whole life
So baby I’m alright with just a kiss goodnight

No I don’t want to say goodnight
I know it’s time to leave
But you’ll be in my dreams
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
No I don’t want to mess this thing up
I don’t want to push too far

Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I’ve been waiting for my whole life
So baby I’m alright
Ohh...
Let’s do this right with just a kiss goodnight
With a kiss goodnight
A kiss goodnight
