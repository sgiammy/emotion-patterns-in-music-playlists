Hey, I was doing just fine just before I met you
I drink too much and that's an issue but I'm okay
Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again

I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car and
Four years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar and
I can't stop
No, I-I-I-I can't stop

So baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder

Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
We ain't ever getting older

You look as the good as the day as I met you
I forgot just why I left you, I was insane
Stay and play that Blink-One Eighty-Two song
That we beat to death in Tucson, okay?

I know it breaks your heart

We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older (we ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older (we ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older (we ain't ever getting older)
We ain't ever getting older

We ain't ever getting older
No we ain't ever getting older
