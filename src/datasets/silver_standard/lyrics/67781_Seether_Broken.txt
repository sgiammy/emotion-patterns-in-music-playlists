I wanted you to know I love the way you laugh
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away
I keep your photograph and I know it serves me well
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain

'Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome 
And I don't feel right when you're gone away

You've gone away 
You don't feel me here anymore

The worst is over now and we can breathe again
I wanna hold you high and you steal my pain away
There's so much left to learn, and no one left to fight
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain

'Cause I'm broken when I'm open 
And I don't feel like I am strong enough
'Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you're gone away

'Cause I'm broken when I'm open 
And I don't feel like I am strong enough 
'Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you're gone away

'Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome 
And I don't feel right when you're gone 
You've gone away 
You don't feel me here anymore
