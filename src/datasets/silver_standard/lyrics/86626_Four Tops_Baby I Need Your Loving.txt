Baby, I need your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'

Although you're never near
Your voice I often hear
Another day, another night
I long to hold you tight
'Cause I'm so lonely

Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'

Some say it's a sign of weakness
For a man to beg
Then weak I'd rather be
If it means havin' you to keep
'Cause lately I've been losin' sleep

Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'

Empty nights echo your name
Whoa, sometimes I wonder
Will I ever be the same?
Oh yeah

When you see me smile, you know
Things have gotten worse
Any smile you might see
Has all been rehearsed

Darlin', I can't go on without you
This emptiness won't let me live without you
This loneliness inside me, darlin'
Makes me feel half alive

Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'

Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
