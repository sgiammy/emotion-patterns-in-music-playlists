Lil Uzi Vert
Girl you're cool but you know I could find a better you
Feelings ain't changed but you might need somethin' new
Yeah, might need a better dude
Louis Vuitton, Gabana, Prada, the better shoes

Put my peddle to the floor
Yeah, make it roar
Pull up, skrt, 'Ventador
Jump out, uh, lift my door

And that bitch kinda hard to handle
Chop it, flip it, move it out the bando
Hold up in a Bentley, foreign cars are random
Matter of fact I probably want the Phantom, yeah
