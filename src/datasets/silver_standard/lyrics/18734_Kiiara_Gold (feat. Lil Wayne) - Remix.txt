Roof is falling, let me love me, falling, I just know
Roof is falling, let me love me, falling, I just know
Roof is falling, let me love me, falling, I just know
Roof is falling, let me love me

Gold up in my, gold up in my teeth
(Gold up, gold up in my teeth)
Don't care what you say to me
I'ma bite your feelings out (gold up in my teeth)
I missed you in the basement
(Gold up in my teeth)
But your brother was a good substitute for you

And if you love me, love me, but you never let me go
And when the roof was on fire, you never let me know
Say you're sorry honey, but you never really show
And I could leave a party without ever letting you know
Without ever letting you know

Roof is falling, let me love me, falling, I just know
Roof is falling, let me love me without ever letting you know
Roof is falling, let me love me, falling, I just know
Roof is falling, let me love me without ever letting you know

Roof is falling, let me love me, falling, I just know
Roof is falling, let me love me without ever letting you know
Roof is falling, let me love me, falling, I just know
Without ever letting you know

Gold up in my, gold up in my teeth
(Gold up, gold up in my teeth)
Tastes like money when I speak
(Gold up, gold up in my teeth)
And I missed you in the basement
(Gold up in my teeth)
Bodies on the pavement
(Gold up in my teeth)

And if you love me, love me, but you never let me go
And when the roof was on fire, you never let me know
Say you're sorry honey, but you never really show
(Gold up in my teeth)
And I could leave a party without ever letting you know
Without ever letting you know

Roof is falling, let me love me, falling, I just know
Roof is falling, let me love me without ever letting you know
Roof is falling, let me love me, falling, I just know
Roof is falling, let me love me without ever letting you know

Roof is falling, let me love me, falling, I just know
Roof is falling, let me love me without ever letting you know
Roof is falling, let me love me, falling, I just know
Without ever letting you know

Gold up in my, gold up in my teeth
(Gold up, gold up in my teeth)
Tastes like money when I speak
(Gold up, gold up in my teeth)
And I missed you in the basement
(Gold up in my teeth)
Bodies on the pavement (oh)

And if you love me, love me, but you never let me go
And when the roof was on fire, you never let me know
Say you're sorry honey, but you never really show (gold up in my teeth)
And I could leave a party without ever letting you know
Without ever letting you know

Roof is falling, let me love me, falling, I just know
Roof is falling, let me love me without ever letting you know
Roof is falling, let me love me, falling, I just know
Roof is falling, let me love me without ever letting you know

Roof is falling, let me love me, falling, I just know
Roof is falling, let me love me without ever letting you know
Roof is falling, let me love me, falling, I just know
Without ever letting you know
