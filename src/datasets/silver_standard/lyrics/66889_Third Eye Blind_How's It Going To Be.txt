I'm only pretty sure that I can't take anymore,
Before you take a swing, I wonder what are we fighting for,
When I say out loud, I want to get out of this
I wonder, is there anything I'm going to miss?

I wonder
How it's going to be, when you don't know me
How's it going to be, when you're sure I'm not there?
How's it going to be, when there is no one there to talk to
Between you and me?
'Cause I don't care
How's it going to be?
How's it going to be?

Where we used to laugh, there's a shouting match,
Sharp as a thumbnail scratch,
A silence I can't ignore,
Like the hammock by the doorway we spent time in,
Swings empty,
I don't see lightning like last fall
When it was always about to hit me

I wonder
How's it going to be, when it goes down?
How's it going to be, when you're not around?
How's it going to be, when you find out there was nothing
Between you and me?
'Cause I don't care
How's it going to be

How's it going to be,
When you don't know me, any more?
And how's it going to be

Want to get myself back in again,
The soft dive of oblivion
I want to taste the salt on your skin
The soft dive of oblivion, oblivion

How's it going to be,
When you don't know me, anymore?
How's it going to be?
How's it going to be?
How's it going to be?
