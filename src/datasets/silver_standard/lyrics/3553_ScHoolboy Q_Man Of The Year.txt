Y-y-y-yeah

Bruh I see, girls everywhere
Titties, ass, hands in the air
It's a party over here
Shake it for the man of the year
Uh ma-man of the year
Ma-man of the bounce

Bruh I see, girls everywhere
Titties, ass, hands in the air
It's a party over here
Shake it for the man of the year
Uh ma-man of the year
Ma-man of the bounce

Yeah, home of the party and the trees
Sunny la-land of the G's
Please let a nigga breathe
Tank top top down for the breeze
Burnt lips, got a blunt full of weed
Peace, love, enemies
Nigga I ain't come for the beef
You ain't know she came for the skeet?
Got pipe for the cheeks
Nigga, I'm the life of the beat
Fuck that bitch, she ain't gotta eat
B-bounce for the crown
You be hating and I still hold it down
When you round man the girls never lounge
Man I heard you a hound
Bruh man, that bitch need a pound
Tip, tip, tip bounce out her gown
Hands high to the sound
Uh yeah I'm the rich nigga now
Bi-bitch, I'm the talk of the town
Make a bitch run her mouth
Go south for the border
Pop, pop, pop, down to the floor
Bounce

Uuh, (uuh)
A-huh, (a-huh)
Bounce, bounce, bounce

Bruh I see, girls everywhere
Titties, ass, hands in the air
It's a party over here
Shake it for the man of the year
Uh ma-man of the year
Ma-man of the bounce

Bruh I see, girls everywhere
Titties, ass, hands in the air
It's a party over here
Shake it for the man of the year
Uh ma-man of the year
Ma-man of the bounce

Bruh I see, girls everywhere
Titties, ass, hands in the air
It's a party over here
Shake it for the man of the year
Uh ma-man of the year
Ma-man of the bounce

Uuh, (uuh)
A-huh, (a-huh)
Bounce, bounce, bounce

Uuh, (uuh)
A-huh, (a-huh)
Bounce, bounce, bounce

Uuh, (uuh)
A-huh, (a-huh)
Bounce, bounce, bounce

Home of the slangin' on the curb
Weed card every corner sell herb
Watch you fly to a bird
Nigga I could pitch you a curb
Let this real shit occur
Make mills from a verb
Nigga cop a crib in the burbs
Nigga you ain't said nothing but a word
Smoke something for ya nerve
Home of the paid on the first
Then nigga going broke by the third
Bounce for the crown
Fast forward getting real tell me now
Every dog need a cat to meow
Every once in a while
I see hands in the crowds
See whites, blacks blazing a pound, ju-jumping around
Tits, ass bump out her gown
B-b-b-bounce from the ground
High for the sound
This verse straight from the morgue
Pop, pop, pop down from the floor
Bounce

Uuh, (uuh)
A-huh, (a-huh)
Bounce, bounce, bounce

Bruh I see, girls everywhere
Titties, ass, hands in the air
It's a party over here
Shake it for the man of the year
Uh ma-man of the year
Ma-man of the bounce

Bruh I see, girls everywhere
Titties, ass, hands in the air
It's a party over here
Shake it for the man of the year
Uh ma-man of the year
Ma-man of the bounce

Bruh I see, girls everywhere
Titties, ass, hands in the air
It's a party over here
Shake it for the man of the year
Uh ma-man of the year
Ma-man of the bounce

Uuh, (uuh)
A-huh, (a-huh)
Bounce, bounce, bounce

Uuh, (uuh)
A-huh, (a-huh)
Bounce, bounce, bounce

Uuh, (uuh)
A-huh, (a-huh)
Bounce, bounce, bounce
