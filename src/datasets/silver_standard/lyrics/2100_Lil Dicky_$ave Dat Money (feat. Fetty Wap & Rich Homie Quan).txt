LD, AKA The Independent Variable
Trap God, and we servin' up the whole world

Ay, where the gold at, baby?
Ay, where the clothes at, baby?
Ay, where the dough at, baby?
In the bank, you know I ain't tryna blow that, baby
Ay, we gon' save that money (I'm so thrifty)
Ay, we gon' save that money (I'm so stingy)
Ay, we gon' save that money
What we do? We gon' save that money

Rap game got it all wrong
We ain't 'bout to go and spend money just to flex on them
We ain't really got it like y'all (Yeah, baby!)
I'm a type of motherfucker that'll check the check
Do the math, I ain't never gettin' robbed
Those margaritas not goin' on my card
I ain't 'bout to split a damn thing for convenience sake
I'm at the restaurant workin' that waitress
Hold up
You ain't heard of Lil Dave, Yung L, The Jew Biz Major?
Fuck you know about the world he raised in?
I've been savin' money since a motherfucker thirteen
I wear the same pair of jeans everyday
Free sandwiches, homie, two stamps away
Book flight December but I leave in May
Drugs are generic but still work the same
I get logins for Netflix from my cousin Greg
Thanks Greg!

All of my luggage is Louie V, I swear to God, nigga
All of my bitches be scared of me, I put that rod in 'em
All of them bitches actin' thoughtless, I disregard them
All of them bitches actin' holy, ain't got no God in 'em
I can teach a lil nigga somethin', preacher
I can take his ass church fresh as hell, no Easter
I can make his ass burp like a baby without no hiccup
I can...

Quan what's this have to do with saving money though?
You know a full verse would have been too expensive anyways
I think

I ain't parkin' that unless the meter green, homie
Hair cut several months in-between, homie
Hit the motherfuckin' lights when I leave, homie
Single ply TP ass bleed
Airbnb the mother fucker, least I'm never there
I'm in Cali, why the fuck my company in Delaware?
Happy hour takin' out the chicken, I don't even care
That applies to both dating and wings
Peep matinees phone bill got the motherfuckin' fam on it
401k rollin' over bands on it
Coppin' sweaters in the summer when the sale on them
The fuck you rappers bragging bout? You overpaying for it

Ay, where the gold at, baby?
Ay, where the clothes at, baby?
Ay, where the dough at, baby?
In the bank, you know I ain't tryna blow that, baby
Ay, we gon' save that money (I'm so thrifty)

I ain't never hit a bar with a cover
Low thread count, hard with the covers
Free trial memberships though
I never join the shiz though
Fuck you think this is though?
Frequent flying like a motherfuckin finch do
General Tso, half a dozen on the stick
Just so I can whet the appetite of dick
What you talkin' about?
My AC never doing nothing, blow fans
Walgreens card shoppin' all the off brands
Boy go hard when collecting, got Venmo
Save every motherfuckin' roach, tryna smoke
Check the clothes in my drawers, I ain't playin' around
It's LD, lil boy, Mr. Hand-me-down
Dirty drawers gettin' worn, can you blame me now?
You think I got $4.50 up in quarters on me well I fucking don't!

Ay, where the gold at, baby?
Ay, where the clothes at, baby?
Ay, where the dough at, baby?
In the bank, you know I ain't tryna blow that, baby
Ay, we gon' save that money (I'm so thrifty)
Ay, we gon' save that money (I'm so stingy)
Ay, we gon' save that money

Everytime these niggas tryna play
And lately I've been stackin' up crazy
Stackin' up cause all about the bands, baby
800k underneath the bed baby

If you at a restaurant and got an iced coffee
And the waiter been refillin' that without a word of caution
And you get your fuckin' bill and you can see 'em double chargin'
For the coffee and you told 'em there's a problem
Sing along like
Oh, don't double charge for me for that
Oh, don't double charge for me, we like
Oh, don't double charge for me for that
Don't do it to yourself
'Cause I might just ask what the ice cube's worth
That's the only differentiator making this a non-free perk
And I might make work more difficult for you than it need be
So think about it, take a minute, let it breathe, B
But think about it, bruh, you saw me take the burger with the bacon on the side
After looking at the price of the side of just bacon
And comparing it to the what the difference in the cheeseburger
Verse the bacon cheeseburger was and making my decision
I would hate to be the waiter trying to tell me something different
I'mma get on Yelp in a minute and review
This piece of shit place like only a kike know how
Unless you take the extra coffee off I might get loud unless you...
Oh, it was just an accident?
You didn't even mean that [snicker]
You didn't even... that was... that's... I'm so embarrassed
