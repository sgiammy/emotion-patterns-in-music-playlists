Go!

You have no heart left to break
Now your Soul has grown weary
The numbness you now feel
Growing stronger with the distance

Now you're alone
Your sacrifice goes unrecognised

You'll die inside
Inside you'll die
Everything that you ever knew as sacred
Has now left you blind


No silver lining
Humanity has made you a slave

Go!

You have no hope left to take
You sold your mind to the devil
All the self doubt you know feel
Believing every word you were told
Still alone
Your effort have all gone for not
