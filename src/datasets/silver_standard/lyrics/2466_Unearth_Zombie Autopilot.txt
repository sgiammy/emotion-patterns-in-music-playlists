It was last night
On the midnight train back home
I ran into this one yet unfamiliar tone
I know I should have known
It was last night
I knew I should have known
Chaos
Our busy minds asleep
We drudge across the land
Is this the coming end
Of our monarchy harmless
We meet increased demands
Is this the life
We all had in our dreams
Our eternal nightmare
All of us are blind to others
Hide behind our plans to nothing
Cage us
We weep in self defeat
All humanity is lost
In this eternal nightmares
All days are lost to conditioned zones
All days are lost to what we know free us
A piece of mind
Gone are dreamers
Who strive to know
All of us are blind
