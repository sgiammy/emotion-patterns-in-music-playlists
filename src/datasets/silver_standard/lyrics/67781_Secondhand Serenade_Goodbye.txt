It's a shame that it had to be this way
It's not enough to say I'm sorry
It's not enough to say I'm sorry

Maybe I'm to blame
Or maybe were the same
But either way I can't breathe
Either way I can't breathe

All I had to say is goodbye
We're better off this way
We're better off this way

I'm alive but I'm losing all my drive
Cause everything were been through
And everything about you
Seemed to be a lie
A guiltless twisted lie
It made me learn to hate you
Or hate myself for letting it pass by

All I had to say is goodbye
We're better off this way
We're better off this way
All I had to say is goodbye
We're better off this way
We're better off this way

And every, everything isn't only
What it seemed so hold these
Words that you never told me
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
It's time to say goodbye
Goodbye

Bye

Take my pain away
Tear it out
Tell me I was wrong
Tell me I was wrong

Take my pain away
Tear it out
Tell me I was wrong
Tell me I was wrong

Take my pain away
Tear it out
Tell me I was wrong
Tell me I was wrong

(Repeat until fade)
