Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Come on, now

If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We three-wheelin' in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh, why do I love this way? (Hey, must be the money!)
If you wanna go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benzy
Oh, why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

In the club on the late night, feelin' right
Lookin' tryin' to spot somethin' real nice
Lookin' for a little shorty hot and horny so that I can take home
I can take home
She can be 18, 18 with an attitude
Or 19 kinda snotty actin' real rude
Boo, as long as you a thicky thicky thick girl, you know that it's on
You know that it's on

I peepin' somethin' comin' towards me up the dance flo'
Sexy and real slow, hey
Sayin' she was peepin' and, "I dig the last video"
"So when, Nelly, can we go?"
How could I tell her no?
Her measurements was 36-25-34
Yellin' I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you boo from way over there

If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We three-wheelin' in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh, why do I love this way? (Hey, must be the money!)
If you wanna go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benzy
Oh, why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

Face and body, front and back, don't know how to act
Without no vouchers or no boozers, she's bringin' nuttin' back
You should feel the impact, shop on plastic
When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that, 4 dot 6 Range
Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes
It feel strange now
Makin' a livin' off my brain instead of 'caine now
I got the title from my mama put the whip in my own name now
Damn, shit done changed now
Runnin' credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the man now, in and out my own town
I'm gettin' pages out of New Jersey, from Courtney B
Tellin' me about a party up in NYC
Can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight
Payin' cash, first class, sittin' next to Vanna White (come on)

If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We three-wheelin' in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh, why do I love this way? (Hey, must be the money!)

Check, check
Yo, I know somethin' you don't know
And I got somethin' to tell ya
You won't believe how many people straight doubted the flow
Most said that I was a failure
But now the same muthafuckers askin' me fo' dough
And I'm yellin' "I can't help ya"
"But, Nelly, can we get tickets to the next show?"
Hell no! (What's with you?!) You for real?

City Spud:
Hey yo, now that I'm a fly guy, and I fly high
Niggas wanna know why, why I fly by
But yo it's all good, Range Rover, all wood
Do me like you should, fuck me good, suck me good
We be no stud niggas, wishin' you was niggas
Poppin' like we drug dealers, sippin' Crissy, bubb' mackin
Honey in the club, me in the Benz
Icy grip, tellin' me to leave wit you and your friends
So if shorty wanna... knock (knock), we knockin' to this
And if shorty wanna... rock (rock), we rockin' to this
And if shorty wanna... pop (pop), we poppin' the Crist'
Shorty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist
City talk, Nelly listen; Nelly talk, City listen
When I fuck fly bitches; when I walk, pay attention
See the ice and the glist'; niggas starin' or they diss
Hunnies lookin' all they wish, come on boo, give me kiss, come on
