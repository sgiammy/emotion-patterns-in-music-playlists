Alright, already the show goes on
All night, till the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on!

Alright, already the show goes on

Have you ever had the feeling that you was being had?
Don't that shit make you mad?
They treat you like a slave, with chains all on your soul
And put whips up on your back

They be lying through they teeth
Hope you slip up off your path
I don't switch up I just laugh
Put my kicks up on they desk

Unaffected by they threats than get busy on they ass
See that's how that Chi-Town made me
That's how my daddy raised me
That glittering may not be gold, don't let no body play me

If you are my homeboy, you never have to pay me
Go on and put your hands up, when times are hard you stand up
L-U-P the man, cause a brand that the fans trust
So even if they ban us they'll never slow my plans up!

Alright, already the show goes on
All night, till the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on!

One in the air for the people that ain't here
Two in the air for the father that's there
Three in the air for the kids in the ghetto
Four for the kids who don't wanna be there
None for the niggas trying to hold them back
Five in the air for the teacher not scared
To tell those kids that's living in the ghetto
That the niggas holdin' back that the world is theirs!

Yeah yeah, the world is yours, I was once that little boy
Terrified of the world
Now I'm on a world tour
I will give up everything, even start a world war
For these ghettos girls and boys I'm rapping around the world for!

Africa to New York, Haiti then I detour, Oakland out to Auckland
Gaza Strip to Detroit, say hip-hop only destroy
Tell 'em look at me, boy!
I hope your son don't have a gun and that would be a D-boy

Alright, already the show goes on
All night, till the morning we dream so long

So no matter what you been through
No matter what you into
No matter what you see when you look outside your window
Brown grass or green grass
Picket fence or barbed wire
Never ever put them down
You just lift your arms higher
Raise 'em till your arms tired

Let 'em know you're there
That you struggling and survivin' that you gonna persevere
Yeah, ain't nobody leavin', nobody goin' home
Even if they turn the lights out the show is goin' on!

Alright, already the show goes on
All night, till the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up
The show goes on!
