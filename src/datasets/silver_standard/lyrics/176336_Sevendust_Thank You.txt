So, help me to see
Give me a chance to come around.
All this closure we need
Will evade us all somehow.
On my own
Forgive me, now we know
Where to go from here
You are the beginning and the end
To all of this

Just wait
Feel it coming now
(Find a reason to live, to live)
Fall back
What
No condition
Come on the time has now
Believe, believe in me

So thanks for coming around
And pushing my head back to the ground
Thank you for slowing me down
I need to fall back and start it all over

Been holding on so long
Denying what I've done
I destroyed myself but I wish you well
Completely overthrown

On my own
Release me now I know
All the answers are here we are
The beginning and the end to all of this

Fall back
No condition
Come on the time has come now
Believe, believe in me

So thanks for coming around
And pushing my head back to the ground
Thank you for slowing me down
I need to fall back and start it all over

So thanks for coming around
And pushing my head back to the ground
Thank you for slowing me down
I need to fall back (fall back)

I need to fall back
I need to fall back
Believe, believe in me

So thanks for coming around
And pushing my head back to the ground
Thank you for slowing me down
I need to fall back and start it all over

So thanks for coming around
And pushing my head back to the ground
Thank you for slowing me down
I need to fall back (fall back)
