Sha la la la la la la, 
Mmm, uh-huh
I was down at the New Amsterdam
Staring at this yellow-haired girl
Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation
With a black-haired flamenco dancer
You know she dances while his father plays guitar
So she's suddenly beautiful
And we all want something beautiful
Man I wish I was beautiful

So come dance this silence down through the mornin'
Sha la la la la la la la yeah, 
Uh-huh, yeah
Curl up, Maria! Show me some of that Spanish dancin'
And pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones
Believe in me, help me believe in anything
'Cause I, I wanna be someone who believes, yeah

Mr. Jones and me tell each other fairy tales
And we stare at the beautiful women
"She's looking at you. Ah, no, no, she's looking at me"
Smiling in the bright lights, coming through in stereo
When everybody loves you, you can never be lonely

Well, I'm gonna paint my picture
Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray
All of the beautiful colors are very very meaningful
Yeah, well you know gray is my favorite color
I felt so symbolic yesterday, if I knew Picasso
I would buy myself a gray guitar and play

Mr. Jones and me look into the future
Yeah, we stare at the beautiful women
"She's looking at you. I don't think so. She's looking at me"
Standing in the spotlight, I bought myself a gray guitar
When everybody loves me, I will never be lonely
I will never be lonely, son, I'm never gonna be lonely

I wanna be a lion
E-Everybody wants to pass as cats
We all wanna be big big stars
Yeah but we've got different reasons for that
Believe in me 'cause I don't believe in anything
And I, I wanna be someone to believe
To believe, to believe, yeah

Mr. Jones and me stumbling through the barrio
Yeah we stare at the beautiful women
"She's perfect for you, Man, there's got to be somebody for me"
I wanna be Bob Dylan
Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky
When everybody loves you, oh, son
That's just' bout as funky as you can be

Mr. Jones and me staring at the video
When I look at the television
I wanna see me staring right back at me
We all wanna be big stars
But we don't know why and we don't know how
But when everybody loves me
I wanna be just' bout as happy as I could be
Mr. Jones and me, we're gonna be big stars
