B-b-b-b-b-back-back-back
B-b-b-b-b-back-back-back
B-b-b-b-b-back-back-back
B-b-b-b-b-back-back-back

Cold and black inside this coffin
'Cause you all try to keep me down
How it feels to be forgotten
But you'll never forget me now
Enemies clawing at my eyes

I scratch and bleed just to stay alive, yeah
The zombies come out at night
They'll never catch me
They'll never catch me
B-b-b-b-b-back-back-back
B-b-b-b-b-back-back-back

Light it up, light it up, now I'm burning
Feel the rush, feel the rush of adrenaline
We are young, we are strong, we will rise
'Cause I'm back, back, back from the dead tonight
To the floor, to the floor, hit the red line
Flying high, flying high at the speed of light
Full of love, full of light, full of fight
'Cause I'm back, back, back from the dead tonight

B-b-b-b-b-back-back-back
B-b-b-b-b-back-back-back

Break the skin, spread like poison

Dying slow when we all attack
How it feels to be the broken
You took a piece now I'm biting back

Enemies clawing at my eyes
I scratch and bleed just to stay alive, yeah
The zombies come out at night
They'll never catch me
They'll never catch me
B-b-b-b-b-back-back-back
B-b-b-b-b-back-back-back

Light it up, light it up, now I'm burning
Feel the rush, feel the rush of adrenaline
We are young, we are strong, we will rise
'Cause I'm back, back, back from the dead tonight
To the floor, to the floor, hit the red line
Flying high, flying high at the speed of light
Full of love, full of light, full of fight
'Cause I'm back, back, back from the dead tonight

Back, back, back from the dead tonight

Deep down, for the count, don't you dare cut me out

Never break, never bow
Never beg, not a doubt
The zombies come out at night

They'll never catch me
They'll never catch me
B-b-b-b-b-back-back-back
B-b-b-b-b-back-back-back
B-b-b-b-b-back-back-back
B-b-b-b-b-back-back-back

Light it up, light it up, now I'm burning
Feel the rush, feel the rush of adrenaline
We are young, we are strong, we will rise
'Cause I'm back, back, back from the dead tonight
To the floor, to the floor, hit the red line
Flying high, flying high at the speed of light
Full of love, full of light, full of fight
'Cause I'm back, back, back from the dead tonight

Back, back, back from the dead tonight

(B-b-b-b-b-back-back-back)
Dead tonight
(B-b-b-b-b-back-back-back)
Back from the dead tonight
(B-b-b-b-b-back-back-back)
Dead tonight
(B-b-b-b-b-back-back-back)
Back from the dead tonight
