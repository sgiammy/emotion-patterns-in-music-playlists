Lazy boy
Matty Trump
Yeah, Boston stand up, we got 'em
Oh, Oh, Oh

Baby, you been driving me crazy
Can you be my lady?
Can you be my baby, baby driving me crazy

I'm walking on, walking on broken glass
Got a problem too many girls in class (yeah)
Wanna run a show but they just can't rap (no)
The idea around they head that the kid could rap
Fact, I kill stages all places
Nantucket and ACK city so they could taste it
But I'm real late no way I'ma make it
Back to my classes, the clock impatient (I'm back)
Well, apologize to the teach for me
Cause anything she speaks ain't doing shit for me (ain't nothing)
And my bad can't read notes
Still amazing like a chick with a deep throat
Treading water since the very thin ice broke
Now I'm neck deep in contracts
Psycho (yeah) I'm all right though, or I will be
Shake your ass ma, if you feel me

Baby, you been driving me crazy (crazy)
Can you be my lady? (be my lady)
Can you be my baby, baby driving me crazy

(Baby) Just feel good, just feel right
Rock this crowd all damn night (You've been driving me crazy)
Cameras flash, shouting right, zoning out, taking flight
(Can you be my lady?)
Grab your girl up out this life
Drink hen and coke with ice
DJ spinning all my shit, Cause Sammy Adams what is what they like
(Can you be my baby, baby driving me crazy)

Yeah and I can party with the best of 'em
At school but still can't touch them son
Ain't DC, but flyer then rest of them (oh, oh)
You ain't there I'ma get her num
-Ber, and take her to the hotel room (oh yeah)
Walking on, walking on something new
You and the whole damn rap game too (So)
And I know got one life (One life)
Like you girl, please no wife (no wife)
Blow weed in the club, no white (no white)
Wheelin' females, got no bike
Can't see Sammy, got no sight
Going twelve rounds, yeah go fight (yeah)
Get blessed by the kid Jesus Christ
And the beat stop, sleep tight

Baby, you been driving me crazy (crazy)
Can you be my lady? (be my lady)
Can you be my baby, baby driving me crazy

(Baby) Just feel good, just feel right
Rock this crowd all damn night (You've been driving me crazy)
Cameras flash, shouting right, zoning out, taking flight
(Can you be my lady?)
Grab your girl and ride you smite
Drink your hand, go be might
DJ spinning all my shit, Cause Sammy Adams what is what they like
(Can you be my baby, baby driving me crazy)


Being a man it only makes you better off
Ain't a rock band, no my shits never soft
I look at girls and they always wanna talk
I move around girl, so you better walk
No Tony Hawk but last night
Gave her the whole thing, no half pipe
Got 'em jumping in the club and in the club like
Sammy Adams, damn he do it so right

Baby, you been driving me crazy (crazy)
Can you be my lady? (be my lady)
Can you be my baby, baby driving me crazy

(Baby) Just feel good, just feel right
Rock this crowd all damn night (You've been driving me crazy)
Cameras flash, shouting right, zoning out, taking flight
(Can you be my lady?)
Grab your girl and ride you smite
Drink your hand, go be might
DJ spinning all my shit, Cause Sammy Adams what is what they like
(Can you be my baby, baby driving me crazy)
