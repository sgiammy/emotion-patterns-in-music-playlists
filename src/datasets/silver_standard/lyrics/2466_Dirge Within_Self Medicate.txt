I am diseased
Can't take the pain
I'd rather die than be alive
Inside of the sobriety

Fuel the fire with the weed and the pills and the booze that will set me free
Throw it away, throw it away
This is my new reckoning
Now here me scream

The suffering
It burns like gasoline
So I self medicate the pain
To escape this world of shame
Obscurity leads to severity
So I self medicate the pain
To escape this world I hate
I self medicate

I am dizzy
From suffocating on the lies you feed
Deny deny your hope of sanity

Fuel the fire with the weed and the pills and the booze that will set me free
Throw me away, blow me away, throw me away
This is my new reckoning
Now here me scream

The suffering
It burns like gasoline
So I self medicate the pain
To escape this world of shame
Obscurity leads to severity
So I self medicate the pain
To escape this world I hate
I self medicate

Standing above myself and watching a part of me die
I see it all just starting to fade away
Though it's true I've always wondered
How I would say goodbye to myself

So now I fall again
And I can not pretend
There is no resurrection
So now I fall again
Now hear me scream

I am diseased
Can't take the pain I'd rather die than be alive
Inside of the sobriety
Fuel the fire with the weed and the pills and the booze that will set me free
Throw it away, throw it away, throw it away

The suffering
It burns like gasoline
So I self medicate the pain
To escape this world of shame
Obscurity leads to severity
So I self medicate the pain
To escape this world I hate
I self medicate
