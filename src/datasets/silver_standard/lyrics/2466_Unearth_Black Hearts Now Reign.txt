Take
Rob this world of resource
Burn the oil for fortune
Stealing from our savior
In quest of power
Sealed
Our fate is catastrophic
The coming days of failure
Aborting evolution
In quest of power
Take all you want
And theses bloody skies will reign
Take what's hers
And these bloody skies will reign
Oh mother close your eyes
These bloody skies will reign
Dear savior brace your heart
These bloody skies will reign
Blackened lives
Sunless skies
Our bare world weeps
Black hearts now reign
Blasphemous corruption
Controlling proggression
Our bare world weeps
Black hearts now reign
In solitude a lonely voice is heard
This future of despair is easy to avoid
This future of despair is easy to avoid
Lies strangle this world's hope
In quest of power
