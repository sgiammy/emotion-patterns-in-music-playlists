(I wanna see you work for me, work out for me)

Hey, we got a good thing
Don't know if imma see you again
But is that a good thing?
Cause girl I can't be your man, no ma'am

I know what's on your brain
You're probably hoping it never would end
Like is it the real thing
Or is it just a one night stand?

Let me see you get high and go low
Now girl won't you drop that thing down to the floor
I'm here for one night, how far would you go?
I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me

High and go low
Now girl won't you drop that thing down to the floor
I'm here for one night, how far would you go?
I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me

She like them boy with the big old chains
Ride around town in the big old range
I knew her when I rock big old chains
Now the little nigga doing big old things

Would you look at that, I came back for her
Just to give it to you, like you asked for it
Man that thing in them jeans too fat for it
It rebounds so I caught it off the backboard

I told her, baby girl come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there
And I brag hardly but just to show up at this party
I made what your nigga make in one year, that's unfair but

So is life, take a chance, roll a dice
Money can't buy you love 'cause it's overpriced
Don't overthink just hope it's right
I'm only here for the night

Hey, we got a good thing
Don't know if imma see you again, see you again
But is that a good thing?
Cause girl I can't be your man, no ma'am

I know what's on your brain
You're probably hope it never would end
Like is it the real thing
Or is it just a one night stand?
Well then

Let me see you get high and go low
Now girl would you drop that thing down to the floor
I'm here for one night, how far would you go?
I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me

High and go low
Now girl won't you drop that thing down to the floor
I'm here for one night, how far would you go?
I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me

Carolina blue kicks, fresh on the scene
Hottest nigga on the block, damn girl you mean
They be starting shit, but it's your world
On my Martin shit, you go girl!

She bad and you know it, some of 'em save hoes
I'm not that heroic
Could you be my escort?
Cause just like them two door Fords

Damn, they don't make 'em like you no more
Cole World, real Cole World
Them boys cool, me I'm on fire
Know what's on my mind, tryna see what's on yours tonight

Tonight, tonight
Move slow, cause you wanna live fast
Up late so you probably skip class
Life is a test so before the night pass
Get right, get right

Hey, we got a good thing
Don't know if imma see you again, see you again
But is that a good thing?
Cause girl I can't be your man, no ma'am

I know what's on your brain
You're probably hoping it never would end
Like is it the real thing or is just a one night stand?
Well then

(Cole World)
