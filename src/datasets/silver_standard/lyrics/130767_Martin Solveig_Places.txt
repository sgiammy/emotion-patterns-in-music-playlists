I come back to the places where we found us
Where somewhere between our bad lust
And I could go anywhere, anywhere is home
Yeah I could go anywhere, never feel alone
I come back to the places where we found us, yeah

When I'm not with you, I'm not me
Nothing ever feels good
When I'm not with you
I'm not in control of what I do, it's not me
When I'm not with you, I'm not me
Nothing ever feels good
When I'm not with you
I'm not in control of what I do, it's not me
When I'm not with you

When I'm not with you, it's not me
When I'm not with you

I come back to the places where we found us
I come back, I come back

I'm not me, I'm not me, no
Nothing ever feels good
When I'm not with you
I'm not in control of what I do, it's not me
When I'm not with you, I'm not me
Nothing ever feels good
When I'm not with you
I'm not in control of what I do, it's not me, no no no
When I'm not with you

When I'm not with you, it's not me
When I'm not with you

When I'm not with, I'm not me
Nothing ever feels good
When I'm not with you
I'm not in control of what I do
(I'm not in control of what I do)

When I'm not with you, it's not me
When I'm not with you
