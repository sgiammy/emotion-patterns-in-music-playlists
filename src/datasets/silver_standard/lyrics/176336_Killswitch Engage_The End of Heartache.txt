Seek me, call me, I'll be waiting
Seek me, call me, I'll be waiting

Yeah

This distance, this dissolution
I cling to memories while falling
Sleep brings release and the hope of a new day
Waking the misery of being without you

Surrender, I give in
Another moment is another eternity

(Seek me) For comfort, (Call me) for solace
(I'll be waiting) For the end of my broken heart
(Seek me) Completion, (Call me) I'll be waiting
(I'll be waiting) For the end of my broken heart

You know me, you know me all too well
My only desire; to bridge our division

In sorrow, I speak your name
And my voice mirrors, mirrors my torment

(Seek me) For comfort, (Call me) for solace
(I'll be waiting) For the end of my broken heart
(Seek me) Completion, (Call me) I'll be waiting
(I'll be waiting) For the end of my broken heart

Am I breathing? My strength fails me
Your picture, a bitter memory, yeah

(For comfort, for solace)

(Seek me) For comfort, (Call me) for solace
(I'll be waiting) For the end of my broken heart
