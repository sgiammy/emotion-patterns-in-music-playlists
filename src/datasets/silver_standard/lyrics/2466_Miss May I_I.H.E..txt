This is a breath that I have to take, feel my lungs ignite
Letting you know who I really am and what's on my mind
Never did I think it would come to this, building in my head
I'm sick and tired of being pushed around
But right fucking now

I hate everything, I hate everyone

My thoughts are fading in and the weight is pushing me down
(Down, down, down)
Deeper in my grave
But I cannot escape if I'm already underground
(Ground, ground)
Beneath the agony

In a wake I try to breathe, drowning in my dreams
The more I take of your shit, the more I sink
It's all a ruthless puzzle, missing one last piece
Boiling up lividity as I finally break

I'm sick of it all burying me
Take the weight and let it out
Dying inside to find my life, I suffocate and burn alive

I hate everything. I hate everyone
I hate everything. I hate everyone

My thoughts are fading in and the weight is pushing me down
(Down, down, down)
Deeper in my grave
But I cannot escape if I'm already underground
(Ground, ground)
Beneath the agony

I hate everything
