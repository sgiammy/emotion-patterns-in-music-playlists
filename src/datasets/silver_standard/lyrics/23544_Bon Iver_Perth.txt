I'm tearing up, across your face
Move dust through the light
To fide your name
It's something faint
This is not a place
Not yet awake, I'll raise the blade

Still alive for you, love
Still alive for you, love
Still alive for you, love

In a mother out a moth
Furled forests, for the soft
Gotta know been lead aloft
So I'm ridding all your stories
What I know, what it is, it's pouring wire it up!
You're breaking your ground
