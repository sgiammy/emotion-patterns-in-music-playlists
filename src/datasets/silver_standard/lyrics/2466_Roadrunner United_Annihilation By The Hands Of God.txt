The prophets of God have left you solaced indeed
A zombie of Jesus insane with his belief
Is all that you know
And all you take as you go
You're one with the rich and only take from the poor

Nailed to the cross by your hands and your feet
Your washed up religion is now worthless and weak
Tenacious conviction has caught up with your soul
There's no place for mercy in the myths of your lord

Little lamb of sacrifice
Full of Bible hymns
Hiding in the house of God
From his suffering
Pray the son will come and call just to make us dead
Bring upon the end of times... worship if you dare

Wiping out masses just for shits and a grin
Is all an illusion of the spell that you're in
Religious confliction has impaired your control
In his resurrection
Revelations unfold

He is you the sacrifice
In the house of bless
Crucify yourself to death just to get to him
Die
Will you

Annihilation by the hands of God
Mutilate me
Annihilation by the hands of God
Unforgiving
Annihilation by the hands of God
Christ ill willing
Annihilation by the hands of God
Heaven hates you

When it's time
I won't look back
Heaven's gates under attack

Satan

Little lamb of sacrifice
Full of Bible hymns
Hiding in the house of God,
From his suffering
Pray the son will come and call just to make us dead
Bring upon the end of times
Worship if you dare

Annihilation by the hands of God
Mutilate me
Annihilation by the hands of God
Unforgiving
Annihilation by the hands of God
Christ ill willing
Annihilation by the hands of God
Heaven hates you
