Come forth for the cattle call
Confront the evil river you can't control
Wicked ways and venomous eyes
Just human nature in disguise
Lost in this world, out on the edge
With death by our sides

Today, I swore that I wouldn't mourn ya
Clouds over California
If that's the way it's gonna be
Then I'll fuckin' go it alone
I'm a saint in sinner's eyes
Curse the clouds over California
This is the call to obey
Let the chaos reign

Bloodshot and weary-eyed
We took you in, full of sin and pride
It'll take you and break you away
It'll tear you apart

Today, I swore that I wouldn't mourn ya
Clouds over California
If that's the way it's gonna be
Then I'll fuckin' go it alone
I'm a saint in sinner's eyes
Curse the clouds over California
This is the call to obey
Let the chaos reign

I'm a saint in sinner's eyes
Curse the clouds over California
This is the call to obey
Let the chaos reign


If that's the way it's gonna be
Then I'll fuckin' go it alone
I'm a saint in sinner's eyes
Curse the clouds over California
This is the call to obey
Let the chaos reign

I'm a saint in sinner's eyes
Curse the clouds over California
This is the call to obey
Let the chaos reign
