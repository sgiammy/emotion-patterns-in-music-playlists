Chances are when said and done
Who'll be the lucky ones
Who make it all the way?

Though you say I could be your answer
Nothing lasts forever
No matter how it feels today

Chances are, we'll find a new equation
Chances roll away from me
Chances are all they hope to be

Don't get me wrong I never say never
Cause though love can change the weather
No act of God could pull me away from you

I'm just a realistic man
A bottle filled with shells and sand
Afraid to look beyond what I can lose when it comes to you
And though I see us through, yeah

Chances are, we'll find two destinations
Chances roll away from me
Still, chances are more than expectations
But possibilities...
Over me

Eight to five or two to one
Lay your money on the sun
Until you crash, what have you done?
Is there a better bet than love?
What you are is what you bring
You've got to cry before you sing

Chances... Chances...

Chances lost are hope's torn-out pages
Maybe this time...

Chances are, we'll be the combination
Chances come and carry me
Chances are waiting to be taken
And I can see

Chances are, the fascination
Chances won't escape from me
Chances are only what we make them
And all I need.
