You went to school to learn, girl
Things you never, never knew before
Like I before E except after C
And why two plus two makes four
Now, now, now, I'm gonna teach you (teach you, teach you)
All about love, dear (all about love)
Sit yourself down, take a seat
All you gotta do is repeat after me

ABC
Easy as one, two, three
As simple as do re mi
ABC
One, two, three
Baby, you and me, girl

ABC
Easy as one, two, three
As simple as do re mi
ABC
One, two, three
Baby, you and me, girl

(Come on, let me love you just a little bit)
Come on, let me love you just a little bit
I'm-a going to teach how to sing it out
Come on, come on, come on
Let me show you what it's all about

Reading, writing and arithmetic
Are the branches of the learning tree
But without the roots of love every day, girl
Your education ain't complete
T-T-T-Teacher's gonna show you (show you, show you)
How to get an A (nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah)
Spell "me," "you" (add the two)
Listen to me, baby, that's all you gotta do

Oh, ABC
As easy as one, two, three
As simple as do re mi
ABC
One, two, three
Baby, you and me, girl

ABC, it's easy
It's like counting up to three
Sing a simple melody
That's how easy love can be
That's how easy love can be
Sing a simple melody
One, two, three
You and me

Sit down, girl
I think I love ya
No, get up, girl
Show me what you can do

Shake it, shake it, baby, come on now
Shake it, shake it, baby, ooh-ooh
Shake it, shake it, baby, huh
One, two, three, baby, ooh-ooh
ABC, baby, nah-nah
Do re mi, baby, ow
That's how easy love can be

ABC, it's easy
It's like counting up to three
Sing a simple melody

I'm going to teach how to sing it out
Come on, come on, come on
Let me show you what it's all about

ABC, it's easy
It's like counting up to three
Sing a simple melody
That's how easy love can be

I'm going to teach how to sing it out
Sing it out, sing it out
Ow, ow, ow, baby

It's like counting up to three
Sing a simple melody
That's how easy love can be
