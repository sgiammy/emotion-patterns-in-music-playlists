My face against the window pane
A tear for every drop of rain
I am so lonely and so sad
You're the reason that I'm feeling bad
I am so lonely and so sad
Living in a dream I've never had

My face against the window pane
A tear for every drop of rain
I'm living like already I have died
Have died

Emptiness a present past
A silent scream to shatter glass
I have to go, its time for me to fly

I am so lonely and so sad
You're the reason that I'm feeling bad
I am so lonely and so sad
Living in a dream I've never had

Wake me with your kiss

Who will care if I'm not here
If suddenly I disappeared
No one is gonna notice it at all

Dying flowers in my hand
I'm vanishing from where I stand
It isn't yet too late to get the cure

I am so lonely and so sad
You're the reason that I'm feeling bad
I am so lonely and so sad
Living in a dream I've never had

I am so lonely and so sad
You're the reason that I'm feeling bad
I am so lonely and so sad
Living in a dream I've never had

I am so lonely and so sad
You're the reason that I'm feeling bad
I am so lonely and so sad
Living in a dream I've never had

I am so lonely and so sad
You're the reason that I'm feeling bad
I am so lonely and so sad
Living in a dream I've never had

Wake me with your kiss.
