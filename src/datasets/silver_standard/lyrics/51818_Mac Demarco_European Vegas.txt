So you think you're lonely, you think that you're the only one
Baby, listen closely, let me be your number one
The city's getting colder, the streets are turning into ice
So baby, hold me closer, let me stay for one more night

Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas
Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas

So baby, take my hand walking down the avenue
I know you wanted Paris, I guess that this will have to do
So come on quit your dreaming, girl I got the master plan
The city isn't so bad, when you're with your lover man

Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas
Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas

Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas
Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas
Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas
Nothing's quite the same as European Vegas
