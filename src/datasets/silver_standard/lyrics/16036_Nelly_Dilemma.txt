Kelly
I love you and I need you
Nelly, I love you, I do need you 

No matter what I do
All I think about is you 
Even when I'm with my boo
Boy, you know I'm crazy over you 

No matter what I do 
All I think about is you 
Even when I'm with my boo
You know I'm crazy over you 

Nelly
I met this chick and she just moved right up the block from me 
And she got the hots for me, the finest thing my hood has seen 
But oh, no, no, she got a man and a son though
But that's okay

'Cause I wait for my cue and just listen, play my position 
Like a shortstop, pick up e'rything mommy hittin' 
And in no time I'm gonna make this friend mine
And that's for sure

'Cause I-I never been the type to break up a happy home 
But uh there's something 'bout baby girl, I just can't leave alone
So tell me, ma, what's it gonna be? 
She said you don't know what you mean to me

Kelly
No matter what I do 
All I think about is you 
Even when I'm with my boo
Boy, you know I'm crazy over you 

No matter what I do 
All I think about is you 
Even when I'm with my boo 
You know I'm crazy over you 

Nelly
Uh-uh-uh-uh 
I see a lot and you lookin'; I never say a word 
I know how niggas start actin' and trippin', I heard about they girls
And there's no way Nelly gon' fight over no dame
As you could see 

But I like your steeze, your style, your whole demeanor 
The way you come through and holler, and swoop me in his two-seater 
Now that's gangsta and I got special ways to thank ya
Don't you forget it 

But uh it ain't that easy for you to pack up and leave him
But uh you and dirty got ties for different reasons
I respect that and right before I turned to leave
She said you don't know what you mean to me, come on

Kelly
No matter what I do 
All I think about is you 
Even when I'm with my boo
Boy, you know I'm crazy over you 

No matter what I do 
All I think about is you 
Even when I'm with my boo 
You know I'm crazy over you 

Nelly
Sing it for me, Kelly 

Kelly
I love you and I need you

And it's more than you'll ever know

You can always count on my love 
Forever more, yeah yeah
