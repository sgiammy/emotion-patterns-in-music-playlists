Stand up like a soldier baby
Yeah, I know you're built like that
Gun it like a holster baby
Show dem' seh' you wicked like that

We live where the war is raging
Chasing our crazy dreams
Hoping that the bridge won't cave in
Tonight we'll let it all go free

Gimme di' thing and mek' me rock inna' di dance
Gimme di' thing and mek' me rock inna' di' dance
Mash it up, hot step inna' di' dance
Gimme di' thing and mek' me rock

Gimme di' thing and mek' me rock inna' di dance
Gimme di' thing and mek' me rock inna' di' dance
Mash it up, hot step inna' di' dance
Gimme di' thing and mek' me rock

Set it ablaze like a candle wick
Hotter, hotter, hotter, hotter, hotter
Yeah light it up, set it a
Light it up, light it up
Light it up

Fire like a soldier baby
No retreating we nuh' pree that
Never make them hold ya baby
Heart nuh' feeble, we nuh take chat

We live where the war is raging
Chasing our crazy dreams
Hoping that the bridge won't cave in
Tonight we'll let it all go free

Gimme di' thing and mek' me rock inna' di dance
Gimme di' thing and mek' me rock inna' di' dance
Mash it up, hot step inna' di' dance
Gimme di' thing and mek' me rock

Set it ablaze like a candle wick,
Hotter, hotter, hotter, hotter, hotter
Light it up, yeah light it up
Set it ablaze like a candle wick,
Hotter, hotter, hotter, hotter, hotter
Yeah light it up, light it up
Light it up, light it up
Light it up
