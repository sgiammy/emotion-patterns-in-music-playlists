I'm livin' in that 21st century, doin' something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music

No one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power
(21st century schizoid man)

The system broken, the schools closed, the prisons open
We ain't got nothin' to lose, motherfucker, we rollin'
Huh? Motherfucker, we rollin'
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So good night, cruel world, I see you in the mornin'
Huh? I see you in the mornin'
This is way too much, I need a moment

No one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power
Till then, fuck that, the world's ours

And then they (Go)
And then they
And then they (Go)
And then they

And then they (Go)
And then they

Ooh, fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell 'em Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my asshole
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas' thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows he so fuckin' gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind, but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity, and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown-up thoughts
Reality is catchin' up with me
Takin' my inner child, I'm fighting for it, custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond-encrusted piece

Thinkin' no one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the powder
Till then, fuck that, the world's ours

And then they (Go)
And then they
And then they (Go)
And then they

And then they (Go)
And then they

Colin Powers, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation
Well, that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of day, goddammit, I'm killin' this shit
I know damn well y'all feelin' this shit
I don't need yo' pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick
I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?
How Ye doin'? I'm survivin'
I was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where ya hidin'?
I got the power, make yo' life so excitin'

Now this'll be a beautiful death
(I'm jumpin' out the window
Lettin' everything go
Lettin' everything go)

Now this'll be a beautiful death
(Jumpin' out the window
Lettin' everything go
Lettin' everything go)

Now this'll be a beautiful death
(Jumpin' out the window
Lettin' everything go
Lettin' everything go)
You got the power to let power go?
