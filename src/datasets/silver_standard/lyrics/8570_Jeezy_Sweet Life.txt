Sweet life, oh my, you turn this to light
All the darkness, scattered out of sight
I've been waiting on this for some time
Now that it's here, I'm going to be fine

When my back's against the wall then I react
The point of no return, hey it ain't no comin' back
Ask me what the difference is, I got everything they lack
And I really touched that bag, see I really had a sack
I done been to Hell and back, I seen Lucifer himself
I seen niggas pawn their souls 'cause they ain't got nothin' left
Fuck all that hopin' and wishin', my nigga, play your position
I know you thought I wasn't lookin' but I was payin' attention
No you can't see through my shades, just know I'm smilin' inside
It's like the old me deceased, I'm kinda glad that I died
This that new and improved, this that I'm in the mood
You know he don't like to lose so why y'all fuckin' with dude?
Hey look it could be that Pac in me, or maybe my prophecy
Won't let you drive me crazy, it's like I studied psychology
Ask me my occupation, I say I live for a livin'
Now what you see when you see me? I did all right for a villain
My sweet life

Sweet life, oh my, you turn this to light
All the darkness, scattered out of sight
I've been waiting on this for some time
Now that it's here, I'm going to be fine

I guess the haters ain't so bad after all
I'm lookin' forward to my haters comin' after y'all
Boy you sure had me fooled, you should've been an actor, dawg
My success, it make you drunk like you've been drinkin' alcohol
Yeah I'm 'bout to go so hard, I'ma make these niggas sick
Ain't no neutral, what's your side? I'ma make you niggas pick
Hey I don't know everything, I just know what I know
Why would you follow them niggas? They don't even know where to go
Won't see me do no complainin', maybe some rearrangin'
Now let's get this understood, sometimes some change can be good
Could be good, could be great, your destiny or your fate
If I wasn't a ghetto prophet I'd still be movin' the weight
Yeah you know when I'm winnin', you see me out and I'm grinnin'
Been chasin' paper since Monday, that's 7 days I've been sinnin'
Count your chances and blessings 'cause they're all God-given
I guess the big magic question is how did I dodge prison?
My sweet life

Sweet life, oh my, you turn this to light
All the darkness, scattered out of sight
I've been waiting on this for some time
Now that it's here, I'm going to be fine
