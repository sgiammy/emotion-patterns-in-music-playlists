Daddy got sober, Mama got his best friend
I've cut down crying to every other weekend
Thanks for asking how I've been
I've gotten to good at hiding it within
I'm okay, things are great but the truth is
Yeah, the truth is

I'm doing fine enough to know that everyone's a little broken
Fine enough to learn that hearts are best when they're wide open
I still got fear inside of me
I'm not okay but I'm gonna be alright
For the first time in a long time I'm doing fine
I'm doing fine

Daddy signed the papers the day I turned 19
Mama drove north to find a new beginning
I blamed God I blamed myself
Then I fell on my knees and prayed like hell
It's funny how a touch of grace gives you healing
Yeah, I'm healing

I'm doing fine enough to know that everyone's a little broken
Fine enough to learn that hearts are best when they're wide open
I still got fear inside of me
I'm not okay but I'm gonna be alright
For the first time in a long time I'm doing fine
I'm doing fine

Oh these growing pains well I wish they'd go away
But I guess you can't be free without a fight

I'm doing fine enough to know that everyone's a little broken
Fine enough to learn that hearts are best when they're wide open
I still got fear inside of me
I'm not okay but I'm gonna be alright
For the first time in a long, long time I'm doing fine
I'm doing fine

Daddy got sober, Mama got his best friend
But I'm doing fine, yeah
