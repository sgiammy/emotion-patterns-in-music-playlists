Screen falling off the door, door hanging off the hinges
My feet are still sore, my back's on the fringes
We tore up the walls, we slept on couches
We lifted this house, we lifted this house
Firecrackers in the east, my car parked south
Your hands on my cheeks, your shoulder in my mouth
I was up against the wall on the west mezzanine
We rattle this town, we rattle this scene

Oh, Anna Sun

What do you know? This house is falling apart
What can I say? This house is falling apart
We got no money but we got h-heart
We're gonna rattle this ghost town
This house is falling apart

Screen falling off the door, door hanging off the hinges
My feet are still sore, my back's on the fringes
We were up against the wall on the west mezzanine
We rattle this town, we rattle this scene

Oh, Anna Sun

What do you know? This house is falling apart
What can I say? This house is falling apart
We got no money but we got h-heart
We're gonna rattle this ghost town
Do you know this house is falling apart
What can I say? This house is falling apart
We got no money but we got h-heart
We're gonna rattle this ghost town
This house is falling apart

This house is falling apart

Live my life without
Station wagon rides
Fumbling 'round the back
Not one seat belt on
Wait for summertime
Coming up for air
Now it's all I want
Now it's all I want
Live my life without
Coming up for air
Now it's all I want
I want everyone
Racing down the hill
I am faster than you
Wait for summertime
Wait for summertime

Oh, Anna Sun

What do you know? This house is falling apart
What can I say? This house is falling apart
We got no money but we got h-heart
We're gonna rattle this ghost town
What do you know? This house is falling apart
What can I say? This house is falling apart
We got no money but we got h-heart
We're gonna rattle this ghost town
This house is falling apart
This house is falling apart
This house is falling apart

We're gonna rattle this ghost town
This house is falling apart
This house is falling apart
