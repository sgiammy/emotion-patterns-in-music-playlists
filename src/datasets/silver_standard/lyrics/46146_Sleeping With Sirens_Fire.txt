Yeah! x2
You made up your mind
Right before the sound can move
Something from your lips
You leave behind
A choice which once before you thought you could not resist.

You give what you have when you
Decide that you
Keep burning like fire,
It's burning you down.

Sometimes they say it should feel something like fire
'Til it burns you as you can't,
You know you can't remain the same
Stay, x5
The same. I can't change.

You're losing your light,
Everything that was yours just does not exist
So don't even try to say
Sorry for the things in life you might have missed.

You give what you have when you
Decide that you
Keep burning like fire,
It's burning you down.

Sometimes they say it should feel something like fire
'Til it burns you as you can't,
You know you can't remain the same
Stay the same,
Although you know
They say it should feel something like fire,
No, I can't change.

Do what you wanna do
Keep building it higher,
Keep burning it down
You lose who you are when you
Keep burning like fire
Like it's all around.

What do you have to prove
I'll pray for you
Keep burning like fire
It's burning you down.

Sometimes they say it should feel something like fire
'Til it burns you as you can't,
You know you can't remain the same
Stay the same,
Although you know
They say it should feel something like fire.

'Til it burns you as you can't
You know you can't remain the same
Stay the same. x3
