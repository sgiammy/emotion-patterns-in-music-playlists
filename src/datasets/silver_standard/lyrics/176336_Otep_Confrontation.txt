Don't be silent, fight!
Violence, melees
And disturbances of peace

Here's your introduction 
To destruction
And the hate sustaining me
Are we safer or in danger?
Drowning in atrocities
Riot gear, the slaves are here
Piling corpses high
It's the rich man's war
But it's the poor that fight

More capitalist crimes
More enemies than allies
No W.M.D.'s 
Who gives a fuck if they die?
Just kill 'em all
Watch 'em fall
Skin the world with their lies
It's the rich man's war
But it's the poor that fight

Stand up, speak out
Strike back!
Stand up, speak out
Strike back!
They don't know 
What they started
Confrontation!

My religion of resistance
Challenging everything
Radicals and dissidents
Of creativity
We are the children
Of the siege you hide
In this rich man's war
Where the poor just die

More deception and greed
More wars and disease
More lies from the high mind
That seek to deceive
A weak nation of need
Like silent thieves in the night
It's a rich man's war
But it's the poor that die

Stand up, speak out
Strike back!
Stand up, speak out
Strike back!
They don't know 
What they started
Confrontation!

Stand, fight
Speak, fight
Strike back!
Stand, fight
Speak, fight
Strike back!
They don't know 
What they started
Confrontation!

This is my battle cry
Defy the lies 
Of the tyrant race
With a fist in the air
And a finger in their face!

Defy the tyrants
Don't be silent
Defy the tyrants
Don't be silent
Defy the tyrants
Don't be silent
Defy the tyrants
Don't be silent

Stand up, speak out
Strike back!
Stand up, speak out
Strike back!
They don't know 
What they started
Confrontation!

Stand, fight
Speak, fight
Strike back!
Stand, fight
Speak, fight
Strike back!
They don't know 
What they started
Confrontation!

There's no way 
They can stop us now
There's no way 
They can stop us now
There's no way 
They can stop us
So let them try
We fight or we die
