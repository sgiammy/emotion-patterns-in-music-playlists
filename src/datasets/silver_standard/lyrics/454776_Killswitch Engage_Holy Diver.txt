Holy diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh, what's becoming of me?

Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes, but you know he's clean
Oh, don't you see what I mean?

Gotta get away
Holy diver

Shiny diamonds
Like the eyes of a cat in the black and blue
Something is coming for you

Race for the morning
You can hide in the sun till you see the light
Oh, we will pray it's all right

Gotta get away
Get away

Between the velvet lies
There's a truth that's hard as steel
The vision never dies
Life's a never ending wheel

Holy diver
You're the star of the masquerade
No need to look so afraid

Jump on the tiger
You can feel his heart, but you know he's mean
Some light can never be seen

Holy diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh, what's becoming of me?

Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh, don't you see what I mean?

Gotta get away
Get away
Gotta get away
Get away, hey yeah

Holy diver
Soul survivor
Yeah, he's clean

Now, holy diver
Holy diver
Holy diver
Holy diver

There's a cat in the middle coming after you, holy diver
Now, holy diver
Holy diver

Get away, get away, get away
Come on
