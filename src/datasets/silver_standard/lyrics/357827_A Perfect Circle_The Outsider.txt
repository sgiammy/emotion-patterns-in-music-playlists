Help me if you can
It's just that this
Is not the way I'm wired so could you please
Help me understand why
You've given in to all these
Reckless dark desires, you're

Lying to yourself again, suicidal imbecile
Think about it, you're pounding on a fault-line
What'll it take to get it through to you, precious?
I'm over this, why do you want to throw it away like this?
Such a mess, why would I want to watch you?

Disconnect and self-destruct
One bullet at a time
What's your rush now?
Everyone will have his day to die

Medicated drama queen
Picture perfect, numb belligerence
Narcissistic drama queen
Craving fame and all its decadence

Lying through your teeth again, suicidal imbecile
Think about it, pounding on a fault-line
What'll it take to get it through to you, precious?
I'm over this, why do you wanna throw it away like this?
Such a mess, why would I want to watch you?

Disconnect and self-destruct
One bullet at a time
What's your rush now?
Everyone will have his day to die

They were right about you
They were right about you

Lying to my face again, suicidal imbecile
Think about it, you're pounding on a fault-line
What'll it take to get it through to you, precious?
I'm over this, why do you wanna throw it away like this?
Such a mess, over this, over this

Disconnect and self-destruct
One bullet at a time
What's your hurry, everyone will
Have his day to die
If you choose to pull the trigger
Should your drama prove sincere
Do it somewhere far away from here
