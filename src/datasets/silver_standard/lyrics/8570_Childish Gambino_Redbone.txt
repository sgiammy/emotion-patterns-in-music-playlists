Daylight, I wake up feeling like you won't play right
I used to know but now that shit don't feel right
It made me put away my pride
So long, you made a nigga wait for some, so long
You make it hard for a boy like that to know wrong
I'm wishing I could make this mine, oh

If you want it, yeah
You can have it, oh, oh, oh
If you need it, ooh
We can make it, oh
If you want it
You can have it

But stay woke
Niggas creepin' (niggas creepin')
They gon' find you (they gon' find you)
Gon' catch you sleepin' (ooh)
Now stay woke (stay woke)
Niggas creepin' (niggas creepin')
Now don't you close your eyes

Too late
You wanna make it right, but now it's too late
My peanut butter chocolate cake with Kool-Aid
I'm trying not to waste my time

If you want it, oh
You can have it, you can have it
If you need it
You better believe in something
We can make it, ah
If you want it
You can have it, ah!

But stay woke
(Stay woke! Stay woke!)
Niggas creepin'
(They be creeping)
They gon' find you
(They gon' find you)
Gon' catch you sleepin'
(They gon' catch you sleepin' boy)
Put your hands up on me

Now stay woke
Niggas creepin'
Now don't you close your eyes
But stay woke
(Woo, ah!)
Niggas creepin'
(Niggas creepin')
They gon' find you
(Find you)
Gon' catch you sleepin'
(Gon' catch you, gon' catch you)
Now stay woke
(Stay woke)
Niggas creepin'
(Niggas creepin')
Don't you close your eyes

Baby get so scandalous, oh
How'd it get so scandalous?
Oh-oh, baby, you...
How'd it get...
So scandalous?
Oh, we get so scandalous
But stay woke
But stay woke
