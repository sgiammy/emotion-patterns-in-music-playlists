I always wanted to stunt so hard
I always wanted to ride that whip
I always wanted to fuck that bitch
Thank you God, I fucked that bitch
I always wanted to live this life
I always wanted to wear that ice
I always wanted paradise
I always wanted paradise

Look, now it don't take a lot to make you rich
I'm addicted to a lot of crazy shit
Man, I feel like money is the best drug
Sometimes, hate can be the best love

Walkin' in like I got cameras on me
Niggas can't control me, ain't no handles on me
Shit don't get out of hand, it get handled, homie
Got a pretty young girl look like Janet on me
She a pretty penny and she know I'm doing numbers
Till we crash up the whole database
I bring it home like I'm base to base to base
Closet lookin' like Planet of the Bathing Apes
Bitch, you think this life just landed on me?
My whole city look like it's abandoned, homie
And we came straight out of those abandoned homies
Every wish we ever had got granted, homie
And I'll never take that shit for granted
Even when the marble floor and counter top is all granite
Back before I got paid any advances
Back when my rollie was ticking, no dancing
Nigga, never did I slip or I panic
Even if I was the captain of Titanic
Riding through the north Atlantic, homie
I never jumped crew or abandoned, homie
All the fruits of my labor organic, homie
Making sure my family tree got hammocks on it
And a good guy can change, 'specially if he saw change
So fuck is my ransom, homie?

Money bag, money bag, money bag (x4)

Straight up, Finally Famous nigga
I always wanted paradise
