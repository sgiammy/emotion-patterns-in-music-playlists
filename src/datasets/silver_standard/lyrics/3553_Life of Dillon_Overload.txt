Know that I been waiting for so long!
You're all that I see
I can't stop this feel oh no
It's taking over me
Feel the mercury rising
I feel your baseline bumping
Hear it in your rhythm
You got my heart beat pumping

Oh I can't stop it
No I can't control it
Can you feel it overloading
Oh overloading heh
You can't stop it
No you can't control it
Can you feel it overloading
Oh overloading heh
