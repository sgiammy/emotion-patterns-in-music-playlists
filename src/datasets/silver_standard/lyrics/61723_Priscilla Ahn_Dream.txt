I was a little girl
Alone in my little world
Who dreamed of a little home for me

I played pretend between the trees
And fed my houseguests bark and leaves
And laughed in my pretty bed of green

I had a dream
That I could fly
From the highest swing
I had a dream

Long walks in the dark
Through woods grown behind the park
I asked God who I'm supposed to be

The stars smiled down on me
God answered in silent reverie
I said a prayer and fell asleep

I had a dream
That I could fly
From the highest tree
I had a dream

Now I'm old and feeling gray
I don't know what's left to say
About this life I'm willing to leave

I lived it full and I lived it well
There's many tales I've lived to tell
I'm ready now
I'm ready now
I'm ready now

To fly from the highest wing
I had a dream
