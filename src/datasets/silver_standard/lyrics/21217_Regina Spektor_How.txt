How can I forget your love?
How can I never see you again?
There is a time and place
For one more sweet embrace
And there's a time, ooh
When it all, ooh, went wrong
I guess you know by now
That we will meet again somehow
How, oh, oh

Oh baby, how can I begin again?
How can I try to love someone new?
Someone who isn't you?
How can our love be true
When I'm not, ooh
I'm not over you?
I guess you know by now
That we will meet again somehow

Time can come and take away the pain
But I just want my memories to remain
To hear your voice, to see your face
There's not one moment I'd erase
You are a guest here now

So baby, how can I forget your love?
How can I never see you again?
How can I ever know
Why some stay, others go
When I don't, ooh
I don't want you to go?
I guess I know by now
That we will meet again somehow

Time can come and wash away the pain
But I just want my mind to stay the same
To hear your voice, to see your face
There's not one moment I'd erase
You are a guest here now

So baby, how can I forget your love?
How can I never see you again?
