Oh!

Ooh
Take me to your best friend's house
Goin' 'round this roundabout, oh yeah
Oh, take me to your best friend's house
I loved you then and I love you now, oh yeah

Don't take me tongue-tied
Don't wave no goodbye
Don't break

Oh, take me to your best friend's house
Marmalade, we're making out, oh yeah
Oh, take me to your best friend's house
I loved you then and I love you now

Don't take me tongue-tied
Don't wave no goodbye
Don't break

One, two, three, four
Don't leave me tongue tied
Let's stay up all night
I'll get real high
Slumber party, pillow fight

My eyes on your eyes
Like Peter Pan up in the sky
My best friend's house tonight
Let's bump the beats 'til beddy-bye

Don't take me tongue-tied
Don't wave no goodbye
Don't take me tongue-tied
Don't kiss me goodnight
Don't, oh

Take me to your best friend's house
Goin' 'round this roundabout, oh yeah
Oh, take me to your best friend's house
I loved you then and I love you now
(All right, all right, all right)

A-don't leave me tongue-tied (Don't leave me)
Don't wave no goodbye (Don't wave bye)
Don't leave me tongue-tied (Don't leave me)
Don't

Don't leave me tongue-tied (Don't leave me)
Don't wave no goodbye (Don't wave bye)
Don't leave me tongue-tied (Don't leave me)
Don't

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
