Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's Friday night and I won't be long
Gotta do my hair, put my make-up on
It's Friday night and I won't be long

Till I hit the dance floor
Hit the dance floor
I got all I need
No, I ain't got cash
I ain't got cash
But I got you, baby

Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)

I don't need no money
As long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money
As long as I keep dancing

Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's Saturday and I won't be long
Gotta paint my nails, put my high heels on
It's Saturday and I won't be long

Till I hit the dance floor
Hit the dance floor
I got all I need
No, I ain't got cash
I ain't got cash
But I got you, baby

Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)

I don't need no money
As long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money
As long as I keep dancing

(I love cheap thrills)
(I love cheap thrills)

I don't need no money
As long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money
As long as I keep dancing, oh

Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
Baby, I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)

I don't need no money
As long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money
As long as I keep dancing

La, la, la, la, la, la
(I love cheap thrills)
La, la, la, la, la, la
(I love cheap thrills)
La, la, la, la, la, la
(I love cheap thrills)
La, la, la, la, la, la
(I love cheap thrills)
