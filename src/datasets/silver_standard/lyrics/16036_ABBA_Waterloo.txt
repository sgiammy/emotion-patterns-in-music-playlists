My my, at Waterloo Napoleon did surrender
Oh yeah, and I have met my destiny in quite a similar way
The history book on the shelf is always repeating itself

Waterloo - I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo - promise to love you for ever more
Waterloo - couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo - knowing my fate is to be with you
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo - finally facing my Waterloo

My my, I tried to hold you back but you were stronger
Oh yeah, and now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight
And how could I ever refuse?
I feel like I win when I lose

Waterloo - I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo - promise to love you for ever more
Waterloo - couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo - knowing my fate is to be with you
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo - finally facing my Waterloo

So how could I ever refuse?
I feel like I win when I lose

Waterloo - couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo - knowing my fate is to be with you
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo - finally facing my Waterloo
Ooh... Waterloo - knowing my fate is to be with you
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo - finally facing my Waterloo
