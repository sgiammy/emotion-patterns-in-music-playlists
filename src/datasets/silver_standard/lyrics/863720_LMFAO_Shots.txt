All eyes on me (Yeah)
I'm with the Party Rock crew (Yeah)
All drinks are free (All drinks are free)
We like Cîroc (Uh huh)
We love Patrón (Uh huh)
We came to party rock
Everybody, it's on! (Lets go)

Shots, shots, shots, shots,
Shots, shots, shots, shots,
Shots, shots, shots, shots,
Shots, shots, shots, shots
Everybody! [x2]

Lmfao
The ladies love us
When we pour shots
They need an excuse
To suck (our shoots!)
How 'bout you?
Bottles up
Let's go, round two (Lets go)

Lil Jon
If you ain't getting drunk
Get the fuck out the club
If you ain't takin' shots
Get the fuck out the club

Get the fuck out the club

Buttery Nipples
Jello shots
Kamikaze
3 Wise Men
Fuck all that shit
Get me some gin!

Lmfao
Shots,
Patrón's on the rocks and I'm ready for some shots
The women come around every time I'm pourin' shots
Their panties hit the ground every time I give 'em shots
So cups in the air, everybody let's take shots!

If you feelin' drunk put ya hands in the air
And if you tryin' to fuck put ya hands in the air
Now say "I'm fucked up" (I'm fucked up)
I'm fucked up (I'm fucked up)
I'm tryna fuck (I'm tryna fuck)
I'm tryna fuck (I'm tryna fuck)

Shots
Patrón's on the rocks and I'm ready for some shots
The women come around every time I'm pourin' shots
Their panties hit the ground every time I give 'em shots
So cups in the air, everybody, let's take shots
(I'm fucked up)
