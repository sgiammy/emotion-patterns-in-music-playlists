Mustard on the beat ho

{1: Ty Dolla $ign}:
We can do anything all your wildest dreams
Goin' up in my room
I know you a freak
Let's party, let's drink
Then go to my room
Shake your thighs for the bed
I know you wanna leap straight to my room
You all I wanna see
Come follow me straight to my room

See you there
I see you there
If you ready let's go
If you ready let's go
I want you to want me to care
If you ready let's go
If you ready let's go

.!.

{2: Tyga}:
Follow me to my room a long way from the front door
The front door's a long way from the driveway
My place far, about an hour out, but 458's like catchin' a flight bae
Coco white, you know my smile bae
Wanna ride the boy, yippee-yo-kai-ay
Made her feel so good, she thought I was Kanye
But I'm T-Raww and my room's on the beach ma, ah!

{3: Ty Dolla $ign}:
We a drink, I'll be goin' real deep
In my room
I put that ass to sleep, put your hands on your feet
In my room
I already said you'se a freak but don't be using no teeth
In my room
Got some things I could teach ya girl, I'm a dog with no leash
In my room

I see you there
I see you there
If you ready let's go
If you ready let's go
I want you to want me to care
If you ready let's go
If you ready let's go
