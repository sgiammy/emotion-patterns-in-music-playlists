In many ways they'll miss the good old days
Someday, someday
Yeah, it hurts to say, but I want you to stay
Sometimes, sometimes

When we was young, oh man, did we have fun
Always, always
Promises, they break before they're made
Sometimes, sometimes

Oh, Maya says I'm lacking in depth
I will do my best
You say you wanna stay by my side
Darling, your head's not right

See, alone we stand, together we fall apart
Yeah, I think I'll be all right
I'm working so I won't have to try so hard
Tables, they turn sometimes
Oh, someday
No, I ain't wasting no more time

Trying, trying
And now my fears, they come to me in threes
So I sometimes
Say, "Fate my friend, you say the strangest things
I find sometimes"

Oh, Maya says I'm lacking in depth
Shit, I will try my best
You say you wanna stay by my side
Darling, your head's not right

See, alone we stand, together we fall apart
Yeah, I think I'll be all right
I'm working so I won't have to try so hard
Tables, they turn sometimes
Oh, someday
I ain't wasting no more time
