Pitbull
Mr. Worldwide to infinity
You know the roof on fire
We gon' boogie oogie oggie, jiggle, wiggle, and dance
Like the roof on fire

We gon' drink drinks and take shots until we fall out
Like the roof on fire
Now baby give a booty naked
Take off all your clothes, and light the roof on fire

Tell her, tell her baby, baby, baby, baby
I'm on fire
I tell her baby, baby, baby, baby
I'm a fireball
(Fireball)

I saw, I came, I conquered
Or should I say, I saw, I conquered, I came
This little chico on fire and he no liar
While y'all slippin', he's runnin' the game

Now big bang boogie
Get that kitty little noogie
In a nice, nice little shade
I gave Susie a little pat up on the booty
And she turned around and said "walk this way"

John Ryan
I was born in a flame
Mama said that everyone would know my name
I'm the best you never had
If you think I'm burning out, I never am

I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
(Fireball)

Pitbull
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But I don't care what y'all say
'Cause as the world turns, y'all boys gon' learn
That chico right here don't play

That boy's from the bottom, bottom of the map
M.I.A. U.S.A.
I gave Susie a little pat up on the booty
And she turned around and said "walk this way"

John Ryan
I was born in a flame
Mama said that everyone would know my name
I'm the best you never had
If you think I'm burning out, I never am

I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
(Fireball)

We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down

We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it, we're taking it down

Now we're bringing it, we're bringing it, we're bringing it back
We're bringing it, we're bringing it, we're bringing it back
We're bringing it, we're bringing it, we're bringing it back
We're bringing it, we're bringing it, we're bringing it back

We're bringing it, we're bringing it, we're bringing it back
We're bringing it, we're bringing it, we're bringing it back
We're bringing it, we're bringing it, we're bringing it back
(Fireball)

I tell her baby, baby, baby, baby
I'm on fire
I tell her baby, baby, baby, baby
I'm a fireball
