Gucci Mane
It's party, party, party like a nigga just got out of jail
Flyin' in my 'rari like a bat that just flew outta hell
I'm from the east of ATL, but ballin' in the Cali hills
Lil mama booty boomin', that bitch movin' and she standin' still
I know these bitches choosin' me, but I got 80 on me still
I'm tryna fuck, who tryna chill? 'Cause I'm just tryna pay some bills

I'm multi millionare LaFlare, just watch it, cost a quarter M
Just look at me and look at them, I smashed her on my first attempt
Like Scarface bitch, the world is mine, you should read the blimp
So either you gon' take a ride, or you gon' stay with him
'Cause I got places I can be, I get yo ass on the scene
Gucci, CB VIP, so fuck them niggas, look at me, Wop
