Simple souls overload as I explode data banks
'Cause the earth and space gave birth to this paleface

Supreme -- linguistic -- mental machine
My brain cells swell - the intellects extreme

Fire fills my veins as I proclaim my resistance
To the mind-swapping parasites that feed off my existence

As I -- skin the burn to relearn the royal plan
Out beyond the edges in the depths of spirit land

Its authentic, apocalyptic destroyer
Damaging challengers -- resurrection, disorder

A monument of crisis - I strikes this - your dead
Line my nest with your soul -- cleansed in bloodshed

Battle ready!
Poets gonna take control

Battle ready
Souls violate parole

Battle ready
Violently invade your home

-- Breaking the bones
Of those who pose

Commanding the mic -- striking up a verb-fest
Mass destruction is my function - time to put it to the test

In combat --- attacking since way back
In the days I drew praise for the way that I slayed facts

Formulating flows in revolutionary science
It's the catastrophic prophet from the anarchist alliance

Freaking techniques -- this creature of speech
We feel the fury of devastation 'cause we tasted defeat

I'm alone on my throne in this universe of fear
Royalty divides my soul -- in this role I'm revered

As the pinnacle -- lyrical master -- queen of disaster
I ruin brain fluid -- the UNKNOWN IS WHAT I'M AFTER

Shaking up the world -- just like the 2nd coming of Christ
-- When I write -- thrice divine with this goddess sight

Words will flow -- wounds will grow
Ewe know -- bones will be exposed from the force that I unload

It's THE SOUL EATER! -- mic bleeder with the voice of chaos
I got the nectar of the gods flowing from my mental pod

Gather the flock -- alarm your block
Tell them the shepherds have come and got the keys to unlock

A holy war -- through your veins it courses
More lyrical artillery than the armed forces

Supernatural -- styles be volatile
It's the mind manipulator -- the WAR CHILD

COME!
Shadow soldiers!

We came to defy - living life as a lie
We embryonic satellites need our freedom to fly

TO WATCH YOU DIE! -- agonizing cries are heard in stereo
I'm visualizing battlefield scenarios

In the line of fire -- watching empires fall
Into attack position -- ELIMINATE ALL!

My species!

My species!
No surrender!
