I'm so tired of being alone
I'm so tired of on-my-own
Won't you help me girl
Just as soon as you can?

People say that I've found a way
To make you say that you love me
Hey baby, you didn't go for that
It's a natural fact
That I wanna come back
Show me where it's at, baby

I'm so tired of being alone
I'm so tired of on-my-own
Won't you help me girl
Soon as you can

I guess you know that I, uh, I love you so
Even though you don't want me no more
Hey hey hey hey, I'm cryin' tears
All through the years
I'll tell ya like it is
Honey, love me if you will

Yeah baby
Tired of being alone here by myself, now
I tell ya, I'm tired baby
I'm tired of being all wrapped up late at night
In my dreams, nobody but you, baby
Sometime I wonder

If you love me like you say you do
You see baby, I-I-I been thinkin' about it, yeah
I been, I been wantin' to get next to you baby
Ya see, sometimes I hold my arms, I say mmmm hmmm hmmm
Yeah baby
Meeting you has proven to me
To be my greatest dream, yeah

Tired, baby
Yeah, you don't know what I'm talkin' about
Sometimes late at night I get to wonderin' about you baby
Oh baby, baby
I'm so tired of being alone
I'm so tired of being alone
I'm so tired of being alone
