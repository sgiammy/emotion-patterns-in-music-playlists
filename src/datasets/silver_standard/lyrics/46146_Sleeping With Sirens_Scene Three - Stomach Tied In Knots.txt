Oh, my stomach's tied in knots
I'm afraid of what I'll find if you want to talk tonight
See the problem isn't you, it's me I know
I can tell, I've seen it time after time
And I'll push you away (mmm)
I get so afraid, oh, no.

And I can't live without you now
Whoa-oh-oh
I can't even live with myself
Uh-uh-uh
And I can't live without you now
Whoa-oh-oh
And I don't want nobody else.

I only have myself to blame
But do you think we can start again?
'Cause I can't live without you

All my stomach's tied in knots
