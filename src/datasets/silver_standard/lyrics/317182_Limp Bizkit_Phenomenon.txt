Are you ready?
Ooh, c'mon!

Ain't it funny how time flies, huh?
Out of sight, out of mind (yeah right)
Once again back it's the incredible
Sublimial the infredible D
Once down in the dirt,
Now I ain't even gotta shave when I'm goin' to work uh,
A'ight, looks like I'm drinkin' tonight,
Tomorrow I'll be sippin' on some pedialite (c'mon)

Rock, rock to the planet rock
Don't stop (c'mon)
Rock, rock to the planet rock
Don't stop (c'mon)

Ain't it funny how time flies, huh?
Chit chatter, that shit don't matter
Check the flow, I organically grow,
Like the weed I for sheezy, be letting ya know
Ooh... yeah, kinda feelin' horny,
Who that is? What it say? What it look like?
"20 eyes in my head" misfit,
And I ain't never gonna change. (c'mon)

Don't think you know what the hell I'm all about
(Phenomenon, something like a phenomenon)
Don't think you got my shit all figured out
(Phenomenon, something like a phenomenon)

All you Hollywood rockstars
Hollywood ass, wishin' you had big cash
Rollin' like your pimpin' but ain't really got shit goin'
'Cause you ain't limpin' like the bizkit
You're just sittin' on the sidelines
You just fake kid, if there's a title then I'll take it
Whoo-yah hit ya with the boo-yah...

Want me tell you what I'd do? C'mon!
