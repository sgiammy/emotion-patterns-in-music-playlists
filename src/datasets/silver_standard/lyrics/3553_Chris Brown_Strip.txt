Take it off, I wanna love ya
And err'body wanna touch ya
You're moving right, wanna see what's up under
Then back it up, beep beep, like a trucker
Nice thighs, nice waist, and you know I can't forget about your face
But don't none of that matter, I'm about to make your pocket fatter

Girl I just wanna see you strip right now, cause its late babe
Girl I just wanna see you strip, girl take your time with it
Girl I just wanna see you strip, Goddamn you sexy, Goddamn you sexy, Goddamn you sexy
Girl I just wanna see you

Got my shades on, with my daze on, in the club with a pocket full of ones
This girl booty outta control
Then she go up and down the pole
Which one imma take home, get my freak on

If you ain't freakin', we ain't speakin'
You think I'm playing (no, I'm not)
Let me see you back it up and drop
Yeah, I wanna see your legs in the air

Baby don't worry about your hair, all those tracks
I don't give a damn about that
In the club, they're playing my song

Turn it up, play it all night long
If you think you can and you know you can
Imma give you all this money, money, money

Girl I just wanna see you strip right now, cause its late babe
Girl I just wanna see you strip, girl take your time with it
Girl I just wanna see you strip, Goddamn you sexy, Goddamn you sexy, Goddamn you sexy
Girl I just wanna see you

Pants, shirt, you can take it off
Panties, bra, you can take it off

Red bottom heels, you can take 'em, wait wait, leave 'em on 'cause I like my women tall
You got it hot mama, you're hotter than sauna
I wanna peel them clothes off your body like a banana
The only reason why I dress you in that designer, is to get you out that Dolce and Gabbana

I throw this money up, she watch it all fall
Toot that thang up...
Anything you want baby, you can have it all
Starting with my last name, now they call you Ms. McCall

Girl I just wanna see you strip right now, cause its late babe
Girl I just wanna see you strip, girl take your time with it
Girl I just wanna see you strip, Goddamn you sexy, Goddamn you sexy, Goddamn you sexy
Girl I just wanna see you
