Some voices carry
Through the halls of laughter
As locusts are swarming
From here to ever after

Baptized in the redemption
Sanctified through the redemption
It's the nature of defiance
To go against the Holy Alliance

Know it by the night
Know it by the light
Know it if you will
By the wind up on the hill

Oh, it's blasphemy
It's heresy
What your God allows!

Cringe and bow your head
When the man comes running through
The shadow of your sins are cast
Across the valley below

Baptized in the redemption
Sanctified through the redemption
It's the nature of defiance
To go against the Holy Alliance

Know it if you will
By the wind up on the hill

Oh, it's blasphemy
It's heresy
What your God allows!
