My declaration hurts, just wanna stab it right now

Congratulations, you've found yourself
Been preaching too many times to a hysterical mind
So won't you fucking behave yourself
It's all in there without despair

So you've saved your soul?
It always depends who will deliver
Have you ever known
Such a beautiful mind that gives you shelter

I'm waiting for something to show, I might as well
Just drag me down so low

I'm down the drain and I've got nothing to fear
With a polluted mind
I had my share of losing
Don't you ever cross that line

So you've saved your soul?
It always depends who will deliver
Have you ever known
Such a beautiful mind that gives you shelter

Break the record, in a second
Cherish your mental weapons
Watch the progress from an aspect
That's stabbing the drama inside

I'm waiting for something to show, I might as well
Just drag me down so low
I'm aiming for something to show my punishment
For being down so low

I can't believe how it used to be
Selfish minds were abusing me
Self pity and determined to crawl
Manipulation of a merciful soul

I'm waiting for something to show, I might as well
Just drag me down so low
I'm aiming for something to show my punishment
For being down so low
