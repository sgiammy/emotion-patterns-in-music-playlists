It's not good enough for me, since I been with you
It's not gonna work for you, nobody can equal me, I know
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm while she push up against me
Ooh, is she tipsy?
I had enough convo for twenty four
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body, dancing like GoGo

But you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone, why not?
A fucking good time, never hurt nobody
I got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
If you loved your girl then I'm so, so sorry
I got to give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do

Feelin' like I'm fresh out; Boosie
If they want the drama, got the Uzi
Ship the whole crew to the cruise ship
Doin' shit you don't even see in movies
Ride with me, ride with me, boss
I got a hard head but her ass soft
She want the last name with the ring on it
'Cause I pulled out a million cash, told her plank on it

You are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Now you wanna choose
Just pop the bubbly in the 'cuzi

It's not good enough for me, since I been with you
It's not gonna work for you, nobody can equal me, I know
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm while she push up against me
Ooh, is she tipsy?
I had enough convo for twenty four
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body, dancing like GoGo

But you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Why not?
A fucking good time, never hurt nobody
I got a little drink but it's not gonna party
If you loved your girl then I'm so, so sorry
I got to give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do

You ain't enough for me
Too much for you alone
Baby go and grab some bad bitches
Bring 'em home

Know the jet's on me
I'ma curve my best for you
You don't know, so pick up that dress for me
Leave the rest on

Too much convo for twenty four hours
When you stand next to twenty four karats
She left her man at home
She don't love him no more

I want your mind and your body
Don't mind nobody
So as long you never hurt nobody
Baby girl work your body
Work your body

You are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Now you wanna choose
Just pop the bubbly in the 'cuzi

Why not?
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do
