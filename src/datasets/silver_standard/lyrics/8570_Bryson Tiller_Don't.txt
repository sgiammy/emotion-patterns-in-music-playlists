Don't
Don't play with her, don't be dishonest
Too many games fucks up logic
Talkin' bout, I'm back and I'm better
I want you bad as ever
I want you now not whenever
'Cause I want to give you better
But Baby it's whatever
Somebody gotta step up
Girl I'm that somebody
So I'm next up

Be damned if I let him catch up
It's easy to see that you're fed up
I am on a whole 'nother level
He only treated you like a trophy, not a gold medal

Fuck 'em girl I guess he didn't know any better
Girl that man didn't show any effort
Do all I can just to show you you're special
Certainly with trust we can get this together

And Lately you say he been killing the vibe
But you still role with him, why?
Pull up, skurt
Get in the ride
Left hand is steering the other is gripping your thigh
Stop playing games cause you mine
Shawty you deserve what you been missing
Baby no more games I'm down for business
Play this song for him tell him just listen

Don't
(Play this song for him...)
Don't

Girl, said he keeps on playing games and his loving ain't the same
I don't know what to say-ay but
What a shame
If you were mine you would not get the same
If you were mine you would top everything
Suicide in the drop switching lanes
And that thang so fire baby no propane
Got good pussy girl can I be frank
To keep it 100 girl I ain't no saint
But he the only reason that I'm feeling this way
Giving you the world baby when you get space
Pen game get me laid, baby that's penetrate
Oh baby

Don't
(Ey)

H-Town got a nigga so throwed
Po' up we can party some mo'
Yeah got this drink in my cup
Got a young nigga feeling so throwed
Spit fire and the world so cold
Young money got a nigga feeling old
Spit fire and the world so cold
H-Town got me feeling so throwed
H-Town got me feeling so throwed
Raw paint in the sip can it fold
H-Town got me feeling so throwed
Spit fire and the world so cold
H-Town got a nigga so throwed

(Play this song for em...)

Don't
