Daft Punk:
Work it, make it, do it, makes us
Harder, better, faster, stronger

Kanye West:
N-n-now that don't kill me can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now 'cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now 'cause I can't get much wronger
Man, I been waitin' all night now, that's how long I've been on ya

I need you right now
I need you right now

Let's get lost tonight
You can be my black Kate Moss tonight
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight
And you don't give a fuck what they all say, right?
Awesome, the Christian and Christian Dior
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask 'cause I'm not sure
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
'Cause right now thou hast forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead, go nuts, go ape shit
Especially in my Pastelle, or my Bape shit
Act like you can't tell who made this
New gospel, homey, Take Six, and take this, haters

N-n-now that don't kill me can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now 'cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now 'cause I can't get much wronger
Man, I been waitin' all night now, that's how long I've been on ya

I need you right now
I need you right now (Me likey)

Kanye West and Daft Punk:
I don't know if you got a man or not
If you made plans or not
But if God put me in your plans or not
I'm trippin', this drink got me sayin' a lot
But I know that God put you in front of me
So how the hell could you front on me?
There's a thousand yous, there's only one of me
I'm trippin', I'm caught up in the moment, right?
'Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night
So we gon' do everything that Kan like
Heard they do anything for a Klondike
Well, I'd do anything for a blonde dyke
And she'll do anything for the limelight
And we'll do anything when the time's right
Uh, baby, you're makin' it (harder, better, faster, stronger), oh

Kanye West:
N-n-now that don't kill me (oh) can only make me stronger (oh)
I need you to hurry up now (oh) 'cause I can't wait much longer (oh)
I know I got to be right now, (oh) 'cause I can't get much wronger(oh)
Man, I been waitin' all night now, that's how long I've been on ya

I need you right now
I need you right now

You know how long I've been on ya?
Since Prince was on Apollonia
Since OJ had Isotoners
Don't act like I never told ya

Kanye West and Daft Punk:
Don't act like I (never) told ya
Uh, don't act like I (never) told ya
Don't act like I (never) told ya
Don't act like I (never) told ya
Ugh, baby, you're makin' it  (harder, better, faster, stronger)

Told ya, told ya, never told ya
Told ya, told ya, never told ya
Told ya, told ya, never told ya
Told ya, told ya, never told ya

Daft Punk:
Never over, never over
Never over, never over
Never over, never over
Never over, harder, better, faster, stronger

Work it harder make it better

More than ever, hour after
Our work is never over
