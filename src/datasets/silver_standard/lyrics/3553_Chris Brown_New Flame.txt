There can be one only you
'Cause, baby, God could never make two
And I know you came here with your crew
But I promise you that it feels like it's just us two

Oh, I don't what you had planned to do tonight
But I just wanna be the one to do you right
We're standing here looking at each other, baby, eye to eye
And I'm hoping that you're thinking about leaving with me tonight

Who said you can't find love in the club?
'Cause I wanna tell them they're wrong
Come on, just, baby, try a new thing
And let's spark a new flame
You gon' be my baby
Love me, love you crazy
Tell me if you with it
Baby, come and get it
Maybe try a new thing
And let's spark a new flame

Can't believe you came here all alone, baby girl, where's your lover?
Oh, it don't really matter 'cause I only wanna get to know you better
Baby, baby, baby, baby, I can stand and stare at you forever
Girl, 'cause I won't ever let you go, never

Oh, I don't what you had planned to do tonight
Girl, I just wanna be the one to do you right
We're standing here looking at each other, baby, eye to eye
Baby, I hope that you're thinking about leaving with me tonight

Who said you can't find love in the club?
'Cause I wanna tell them they're wrong
Come on, just, baby, try a new thing
And let's spark a new flame
You gon' be my, baby
Love me, love you crazy
Tell me if you with it
Baby, come and get it
Maybe try a new thing
And let's spark a new flame

Homeplace, world series, sour nigga sliding in her
Baby, I'm a boss, I'm talking George Steinbrenner
Panamera, Yogi Bear'er, my two-seater Derek Jeter
Got more stripes than all these niggas
Babe Ruth balling in a Beamer
Collar on my Polo, kisses on my necklace
All my diamonds watching, now my watches getting jealous
Smoking on a bomb and my autograph Lebron's
Yeah, she told me I'm the one, that's when I only hit it once

Who said you can't find love in the club?
'Cause I wanna tell them they're wrong
Come on, just, baby, try a new thing
And let's spark a new flame
You gon' be my, baby
Love me, love you crazy
Tell me if you with it
Baby, come and get it
Maybe try a new thing
And let's spark a new flame
