My sandpaper sigh engraves a line
Into the rust of your tongue
Girl I could've been someone to you
Would have painted the skies blue

Baby blue
If you knew
Baby blue
Baby blue
Baby blue

Edging closer, you swing my way
Girl I've got no chance
And nothing to say
Girl but stay here for a little while
Baby blue
Baby blue
Baby blue

But if only you could see
My shadow crossing your path
It won't be the last baby

You are my baby
You are my baby
