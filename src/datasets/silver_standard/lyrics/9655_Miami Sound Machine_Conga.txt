Come on, shake your body baby,
Do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Come on, shake your body baby,
Do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer.

Come on, shake your body baby,
Do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it till you've tried it
Do the conga beat

Everybody gather 'round now
Let your body feel the heat.
Don't you worry if you can't dance
Let the music move your feet.
It's the rhythm of the island
And like sugarcane, so sweet.
If you want to do the conga
You've got to listen to the beat.

Come on, shake your body baby,
Do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it till you've tried it
Do the conga beat

Feel the fire of desire
As you dance the night away.
'Cause tonight we're gonna party
Till we see the break of day.
Better get yourself together
And hold on to what you got.
Once the music hit your system
There's no way you're gonna stop.

Come on, shake your body baby,
Do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it till you've tried it
Do the conga beat

Come on, shake your body baby,
Do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it till you've tried it,
Do the conga
Come on, shake your body baby,
Do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it till you've tried it
Do the conga beat
Come on, shake your body baby,
Do the conga
