Someday my pain
Someday my pain will mark you
Harness your blame
Harness your blame and walk through

With the wild wolves around you
In the morning, I'll call you
Send it farther on

Solace my game
Solace my game, it stars you
Swing wide your crane
Swing wide your crane and run me through

And the story's all over you
In the morning I'll call you
Can't you find a clue
When your eyes are all painted Sinatra blue

What might have been lost
What might have been lost
What might have been lost
What might have been lost

Don't bother me
(Don't bother me)
What might have been lost
(Don't bother me)
What might have been lost
(Don't bother me)
What might have been lost
(Don't bother me)
What might have been lost
(Don't bother me)
What might have been lost
(Don't bother me)
What might have been lost
(Don't bother me)
What might have been lost
What might have been lost

Ah, ah

Someday my pain
Someday my pain
Someday my pain
Someday my pain
