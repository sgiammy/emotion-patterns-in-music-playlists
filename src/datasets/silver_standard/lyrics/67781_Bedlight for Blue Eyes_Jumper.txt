I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
You could cut ties with all the lies you've been living in
And if you do not want to see me again
I would understand
I would understand

The angry boy, a bit too insane
Icing over a secret pain
You know you don't belong
You're the first to fight
You're way too loud
You're the flash of light 
On a burial shroud
I know something's wrong

Cause everyone I know has got a reason
To say
Put the past away
I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
You could cut ties from all the lies you've been living in
And if you do not want to see me again
I would understand
I would understand

Well, he's on the table and he's gone to code
And I do not think anyone knows
What they're doing here
And your friends have left
And you've been dismissed
I never thought it would come to this
And I, I want you to know

Everyone's got to face down the demons
Maybe today
We can put the past away
I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
You could cut ties from all the lies you've been living in
And if you do not want to see me again
I would understand...
I would understand...
I would understand...
O-oh...
I would understand...
I would understand...
I would understand...

Can you put the past away
I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
(I would understand...)
You could cut ties from all the lies you've been living in
(I would understand...)
And if you do not want to see me again
I would understand
I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
I would understand
I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
I would understand
I wish you would step back from that ledge, my friend
