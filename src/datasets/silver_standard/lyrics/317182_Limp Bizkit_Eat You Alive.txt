Hey you, Mrs. I-Don't-Know-What-The-Fuck-Your-Name-Is
I'm drawn to you; something's magnetic here
If I could approach you or even get close to the scent
That you left behind, I'd be fine

No doubt now (No doubt)
You bring out (Bring out)
The animal inside

I'd eat you alive
I'd eat you alive
I'd eat you alive
I'd eat you alive

Hey you, Mrs. Too-Good-To-Look-My-Way and that's cool
You want nothing at all to do with me
But I want you, ain't nothing wrong with wantin' you
'Cause I'm a man and I can think what the hell I want
You got that straight? 

No doubt now (No doubt)
I'd love to (I'd love)
Sniff on them panties now

I'd eat you alive
I'd eat you alive
I'd eat you alive
I'd eat you alive

I'm sorry, so sorry (Damn, you're so hot)
Your beauty is so vain (Damn, you're so hot)
It drives me, yes, it drives me (Damn, you're so hot)
Absolutely insane

I just want to look at you (Look at you, look at you, look at you)
I just want to look at you (Look at you, look at you, look at you)
I just want to look at you all day
There ain't nothing wrong, no
There ain't nothing wrong with that (Wrong with that, wrong with that)

Once you seep in (Once you seep in)
Under my skin (Under my skin) 
There's nothing (Nothing), there's nothing (Nothing)
In this world that could wash you away (Wash you away)

Once you seep in (Once you seep in)
Under my skin (Under my skin) 
There's nothing (Nothing), there's nothing (Nothing)
In this world that could wash you away (Wash you away)

I'm sorry, so sorry (Damn, you're so hot)
Your beauty is so vain (Damn, you're so hot)
It drives me, yes, it drives me (Damn, you're so hot)
Absolutely insane

I'd eat you alive
I'd eat you alive
I'd eat you alive
I'd eat you alive
I'd eat you alive
