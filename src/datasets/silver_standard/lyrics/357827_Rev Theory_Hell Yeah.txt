Can you feel that?
You better hold on
This one's about to get bumpy
Hahahahahahaha...

She's a ten, hellbent, I'm in heaven tonight
Six speed sex scene playin' out in my mind
One look, I'm hooked, motor runnin'
Rev'd up, my heart startin' pumpin'
Are you ready for the best damn ride of your life?

Gimme a "hell"
Gimme a "yeah"
Stand up right now
And gimme a "hell"
Gimme a "yeah"
Stand up right now
Get ready to go
She ain't movin' slow
She's takin' control
Pushin' the pedal to the floor
I'm beggin' for more
You better hold on tight

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Got a taste, can't be saved, I'm a junkie for life
She fuels my fire and adrenaline high
My need for speed's got me gunnin'
One touch, she screams "keep it comin'"
Are you ready for the best damn ride of your life?

Gimme a "hell"
Gimme a "yeah"
Stand up right now
And gimme a "hell"
Gimme a "yeah"
Stand up right now
Get ready to go
She ain't movin' slow
She's takin' control
Pushin' the pedal to the floor
I'm beggin' for more
You better hold on tight

Hahahahahahaha...
Almost home
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Hey, hey, hey, hey (yeah)

Gimme a "hell"

Stand up right now (right now)
Gimme a "hell"
Gimme a "yeah" (yeah)
Stand up right now
And gimme a "hell" (hell)
Gimme a "yeah" (yeah)
Stand up right now (right now)
Get ready to go
She ain't movin' slow
She's takin' control
And pushin' the pedal to the floor

You better hold on tight
