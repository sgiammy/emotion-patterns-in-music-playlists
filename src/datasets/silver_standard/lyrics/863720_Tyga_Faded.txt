Young Nino, fuck a bitch in a peacoat
Carlito, Scarface, Al Pacino
Bun B though, Pimp C, R.I.P. though
I goes deep in that pussy, Dan Marino

She wanna be the one, fuck her to my own single
Break a bitch hard, no future Miss Cleo
Snap back, au-au-automatic reload
Flyer than a fucking beatle, you can't beat 'em

Vampire fuck up your evening
I pop up and eat lunch, leave you in the cement
Don't believe it, stripe like a fucking Adidas
The gun Selena, give a nigga Bieber fever

Real fucking hot, put it in park
Take a shot, higher than a tube sock
You a bop, give me top top, as I load the guap
Man these niggas say I'm fly but to her I'm God

I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded

My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
And I don't give a fuck

(Tyga)
Fuck is up, niggas stomping in my Chucks
See I make it rain, dear, 'cause I'm all 'bout my bucks
Use the butt up in the front, dick, dick up in her cunt
And I put it in her hole, hole in one, one, putt putt

Ergggh
Su-Super McNasty, why you McLovin?
When the bitch call me daddy
Pimp no caddy, she wish she never had me
Treat her like a dog, called the bitch Lassie

Young savvy, bang her like Cincinnati
Above average, f-fly like I'm Aladdin
They bend backwards, done the pussy at them
I'm Ben Wallace, dunk up in your basket

Balls in the air, no games, I'm serious, double dare
There's too many bitches, why these niggas wanna stare?
Pat Ron up in here
Nigga, this ain't no beer

I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded

My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
And I don't give a fuck

(Lil Wayne)
Mama, there go that monster
Abracadabra, Magic Johnson
My motherfucking doctor said I need a doctor
So I called House, now I am a pill popper

Faded like skinnys, Young Money we winning
I told her if I change, she won't get a penny
Milking this shit, pregnant bitch titties
Bringing home the bacon, I'm fuckin' Miss Piggy

Loaded like a semi, semi-naked pictures
She knows my dick, she call it nigga Richard
Prior to me coming, I had to stick my thumb in
I asked one time, smell my finger make you vomit

Flyer than a hornet, the shoe fit I worn it
She tried to jack me off, can't beat it, join it
Tunechi, punechi, that what she call it,
Flag Scarlett, I killed it, mourned it

Faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded (Yeah!)
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded (Young moolah baby!)

My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
My nigga I'm faded faded faded
And I don't give a fuck
