Take my misery I give all of it.
Take one chance I'll be there.
Offering all of myself I give everything
For my last opportunity.

Emery stones demonstrate and achieve what I wanted.
Relentless chaos is all that has been.

Thoughts of being greater have fallen fast.
This highland contains whatever may come.
How senseless can you be?
How confused can you be?

Relentless chaos is all that has been.

Look at us now higher than before.
Desire to emulate and create all.
Remember bringing this down?
How could you bring this down?

Please tell me why you tried so hard
Knowing this would happen one day.

Take my misery I give all of it.
Take one chance I'll be there.
Offering all of myself I give everything
For my last opportunity.

Concentrated on destroying this vision.
Try to live this down when I find you begging at my feet.
All your words have fallen to the ground where they belong.
