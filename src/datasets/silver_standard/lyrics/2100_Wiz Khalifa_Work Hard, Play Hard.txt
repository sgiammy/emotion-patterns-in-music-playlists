Diamonds all on my brain, nigga
Gold watches, gold chain, nigga
Hundred thou' on champagne, nigga
Yeah, my money insane, nigga
Yeah, I'm making it rain, nigga
When I was just on a plane, nigga

Buying gear, flying here
Fuck what you heard, it's my time of year
If I'm in the club I get a hundred stacks
I'm always rollin' up so I could laugh at that

Them other niggas stole my swag but I don't want it back
My nigga, uh, I was on this but I'm onto that
You see it in the closet before it's on the rack
Was out there in Hawaii now I'm going back

My nigga, uh
I got so much money I should start a bank
So much paper right in front of me it's hard to think
Find so many bottles it's gon be hard to drink
But I'm still pouring up and my family here
And they rolling up so, ugh

The bigger the bill
The harder you ball
Well I'm throwin' mine
'Cause my money long
The quicker you're here
The faster you go
That's why, where I come from, the only thing we know is

The bigger the bill
The harder you ball
Well I'm throwin' mine
'Cause my money long
The quicker you're here
The faster you go
That's why, where I come from, the only thing we know is

Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard
Work hard, play hard

Hopped your pretty ass up in this fucking car
Bitch I'm out this world, girl you know I'm a star
Used to buying rounds, but now we buy the bar
Last year they had to ask, now they know who we are

'Bout shit, walk in the building, I own shit
You can tell by who I'm on the phone with
Damn nigga, talkin' 'bout grown shit
Nigga, too busy jackin' my swag

Need to fuck around, get ya own shit
Get ya own cars, get ya own clothes
Get ya own smoke, get ya own bitch
Yeah, you ain't reppin' my gang, get ya own clique

The bigger the bill
The harder you ball
Well I'm throwin' mine
'Cause my money long
The quicker you're here
The faster you go
That's why, where I come from, the only thing we know is

The bigger the bill
The harder you ball
Well I'm throwin' mine
'Cause my money long
The quicker you're here
The faster you go
That's why, where I come from, the only thing we know is

Go hard, make sure you do whatever it is that you gotta do
That's your job
And niggas gonna hate but that's no prob'
So hey fuck 'em don't need nothing from 'em
Some niggas talking but the shit they claiming don't mean nothing

It's straight from Cali
That's what's in my joint
That's what I'm puffin'
OG and been one since I was young enough that know that everybody was gonna know me
Most niggas don't see

The bigger the bill
The harder you ball
Well I'm throwin' mine
'Cause my money long
The quicker you're here
The faster you go
That's why, where I come from, the only thing we know is
