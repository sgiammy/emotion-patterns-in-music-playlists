Um, Dois, Tres, Quatro...

Back to the primitive
Fuck all your politics
We got our life to live
The way we want to be

Back to the primitive
Fuck all your politics
Who feels it, knows it
The god will guide me

Back to the primitive
Fuck all your bullshit
We're back to set it free
Confronting the negative

Back to the primitive
Fuck all you wannabe's
You don't mean shit to me
Let it bleed!

Primitive (x4)

Back to the primitive,
Fuck all your politics,
We got our life to live
The way we want to be

Back to the primitive
Fuck all your politics
How it used to be
Check your reality

Back to the primitive
Fuck all your politics
Fuck all your wannabes
Aaaaaarggghhh!

Back to the primitive
Fuck all your politics
Forever we will be
What we want to be

Primitivo
