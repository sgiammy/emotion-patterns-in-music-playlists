Earth angel, earth angel
Will you be mine?
My darling dear, love you all the time
I'm just a fool, a fool in love with you.

Earth angel, earth angel
The one I adore, love you forever
And evermore
I'm just a fool, a fool in love with you

I fell for you and I knew
The vision of your love, loveliness
I hope and I pray, that someday
I'll be the vision of your hap, happiness

Oh, earth angel, earth angel
Please be mine?
My darling dear, love you all the time
I'm just a fool, a fool in love with you

I fell for you and I knew
The vision of your loveliness
I hope and I pray, that someday
That I'll be the vision of your happiness

Oh, earth angel, earth angel
Please be mine?
My darling dear, love you all the time
I'm just a fool, a fool in love with you
