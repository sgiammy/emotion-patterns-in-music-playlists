Oh, I see that on a porch a letter sat
Then he said, "I wanna leave it" again
Once I saw him on a beach of weathered sand
And on the sand, "I wanna leave it" again, yeah

"I wanna leave here, wanna get wasted on the way," yeah
Then I called, and I said that I want what I said, then I called out again
And the reason, wanna leave here, how come, I know
I said, "I know but will it be a box or the bag"

Ah yeah, can you see them out on the porch
Yeah, but they don't wave
I see them round the front way, yeah
And I know and I know I don't want to stay

Make me cry

Ah, I see
Ooh, I don't know, there's something else
I want to drum it all away
Oh, and I said that
I don't, I don't know whether I was the box or the bag

Ah yeah, can you see them out on the porch
Yeah, but they don't wave
But I see them 'round the front way, yeah
And I know and I know I don't want to stay at all

I don't wanna stay, yeah
I don't wanna stay
I don't wanna stay, oh no
Yeah
