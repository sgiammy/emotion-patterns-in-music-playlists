Waiting for your call, I'm sick, call, I'm angry, call, I'm desperate for your voice
Listening to the song we used to sing
In the car, do you remember?
Butterfly, early summer
It's playing on repeat, just like when we would meet
Like when we would meet

I was born to tell you I love you
And I am torn to do what I have to
To make you mine, stay with me tonight

Stripped and polished, I am new, I am fresh,
I am feeling so ambitious, you and me, flesh to flesh
'Cause every breath that you will take when you are sitting next to me,
Will bring life into my deepest hopes, what's your fantasy?
What's your...?
(What's your...? what's your...?)
What's your...?

I was born to tell you I love you
And I am torn to do what I have to
To make you mine, stay with me tonight

And I'm tired of being all alone,
And this solitary moment makes me want to come back home
And I'm tired of being all alone,
And this solitary moment makes me want to come back home
And I'm tired of being all alone,
And this solitary moment makes me want to come back home
And I'm tired of being all alone,
And this solitary moment makes me want to come back home
(I know that everything you wanted was yours)

I was born to tell you I love you
And I am torn to do what I have to
And I was born to tell you I love you
(I know that everything you wanted was yours)
And I am torn to do what I have to
(I know that everything you wanted was yours)
To make you mine, stay with me tonight
