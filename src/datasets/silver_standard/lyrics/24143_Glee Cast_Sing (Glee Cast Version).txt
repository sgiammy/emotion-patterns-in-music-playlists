Rachel: Sing it out: boy, you've got to see what tomorrow brings 
Finn: Sing it out: girl, you've got to be what tomorrow needs
Rachel: For every time that they want to count you out
Both: And use your voice every single time you open up your mouth

New Directions!: Sing it for the boys, sing it for the girls
Every time that you lose it, sing it for the world
Sing it from the heart, sing it 'til you're nuts
Sing it out for the ones that'll hate your guts
Sing it for the deaf, sing it for the blind
Sing about everyone that you left behind
Sing it for the world, sing it for the world (Ahhh)

Sing it out: boy, they're gonna sell what tomorrow means (Oooh)
Sing it out: boy, before they kill what tomorrow brings
You've got to make a choice if the music drowns you out (Music drowns you out)
And raise your voice every single time they try and shut your mouth 

Sing it for the boys, sing it for the girls
Every time that you lose it. sing it for the world
Sing it from the heart, sing it 'til you're nuts
Sing it out for the ones that'll hate your guts
Sing it for the deaf, sing it for the blind
Sing about everyone that you left behind
Sing it for the world, sing it for the world 

Cleaned-up, corporation progress 
Dyin' in the process  
Children that can talk about it
Livin' on the railways
People movin' sideways 
Sell it 'til your last days 
Buy yourself the motivation
Generation nothing
Nothing but a dead scene 
Product of a white dream 
I am not the singer that you wanted, but a dancer
I refuse to answer
Talk about the past, sir
Wrote it for the ones who want to get away 
Keep running!

Sing it for the boys, sing it for the girls
Every time that you lose it, sing it for the world
Sing it from the heart, sing it 'til you're nuts
Sing it out for the ones that'll hate your guts
Sing it for the deaf, sing it for the blind
Sing about everyone that you left behind
Sing it for the world, sing it for the world 

We've got to see what tomorrow brings 
Sing it for the world, sing it for the world 
Boy, you've got to be what tomorrow needs  
Sing it for the world, sing it for the world
