Chest to chest
Nose to nose
Palm to palm
We were always just that close

Wrist to wrist
Toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose
So how come when I reach out my fingers
It feels like more than distance between us?

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I been California wishing on these stars
For your heart for me
My Californa king

Eye to eye
Cheek to cheek
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me (Ooh next to me)

Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets
So how come when I reach out my fingers
It seems like more than distance between us?

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I been California wishing on the stars
For your heart for me
My Californa king

Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then my eyes got wetter

So confused, when I asked you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming
Yeah

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
California wishing on these stars
For your heart for me
My California king
My California king

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I been California wishing on these stars
For your heart for me
My California king
