I breathe in slow to compose myself
But the bleeding heart I left on the shelf
Started speeding round, beating half to death
'Cause you're here and you're all mine

So I press my lips down into your neck
And I stay there and I reconnect
Bravery I've been trying to be perfect
It can wait for a while

Scared of hope in my head it's been making me sweat but it turns out
You're here with your head on my chest
I should've guessed

The world will turn and we'll grow, we'll learn how to be
To be incomplete

I breathe out now and we fall back in
Just like before we can re-begin
Let your lungs push slow against my skin
Let it all feel just fine

Gone is the emptiness
We just take what's best and we move on
All that the hurt gets left
I should've guessed

The world will turn and we'll grow, we'll learn how to be
To be incomplete
This here now, it's where we touch down
You and me let's be incomplete

How'd we go without
I don't know it's look like we've made it again
Tell me you'll never look down, down

And the world will turn and we'll grow, we'll learn how to be
To be incom...

I don't wanna look down
I don't want us to break up in the cloud
All I want is to stay us, to stay with you now

I don't wanna look down
I don't want us to break up in the clouds
All I want is to stay us, to stay with you now

And the world will turn and we'll grow, we'll learn how to be
To be incomplete
This here now it's where we touch down
You and me let's be incomplete
