(After love, after love, after love, after love
After love, after love, after love, after love
After love, after love, after love, after love
After love)

No matter how hard I try
You keep pushing me aside
And I can't break through
There's no talking to you

It's so sad that you're leaving
It takes time to believe it
But after all is said and done
You're gonna be the lonely one, oh

Do you believe in life after love? (After love, after love, after love)
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no

Do you believe in life after love? (After love, after love, after love)
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no

What am I supposed to do?
Sit around and wait for you
Well, I can't do that
And there's no turning back

I need time to move on
I need a love to feel strong
'Cause I've had time to think it through
And maybe I'm too good for you, oh

Do you believe in life after love? (After love, after love, after love)
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no

Do you believe in life after love? (After love, after love, after love)
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no

Well, I know that I'll get through this
'Cause I know that I am strong

And I don't need you anymore
Oh, I don't need you anymore
Oh, I don't need you anymore
No, I don't need you anymore

Do you believe in life after love? (After love, after love, after love)
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no

Do you believe in life after love? (After love, after love, after love)
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no

Do you believe in life after love? (After love, after love, after love)
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no

Do you believe in life after love? (After love, after love, after love)
I can feel something inside me say
I really don't think you're strong enough, no
