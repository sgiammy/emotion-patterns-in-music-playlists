I still remember the night you tried to kiss me through the window.
I tried to settle for the taste of touching glass over the sound of answering machines,
Because I love the way your voice says it's gonna get back to me someday.
As I brace my knees you hold me down with your eyes.

Someday I'll drive, close both my eyes,
We'll swim in circles in the blue lights.
It's gonna be the best day of my life.
Oh my God, you'll never be as beautiful without me.
Beauty needs an animal to breathe.
And baby you'll be all right as long as I'm not.
So do that dance in the dark.
Sharpen your teeth and bite as hard as you want.

Someday I'll drive, close both my eyes.
We'll swim in circles in the blue lights.
And I just want to fade away into the sky under the sea.
A million kisses underwater as we walk into the ocean.
This is gonna be the best day of my life
A celebration of an ending.
Come on!

And do you really trust your tongue or did you bury the taste,
And is this fantasy real, or is it all home-made,
And did you call me last night just cause you couldn't get laid
Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce the Selfish Machine.

Do you think you're the only one! afraid!
Do you think you're the only one! afraid!
Do you think you're the only one afraid of this machine

And someday I'll drive, close both my eyes.
I'll be your breath if you can be mine,
And I just want to fade away into the sky under the sea.
A million kisses underwater as we walk into the ocean.

Oh, no.
Oh, no.
1, 2, 3, 4.
Do you see me at all under the tall waves
Do you see me at all.
