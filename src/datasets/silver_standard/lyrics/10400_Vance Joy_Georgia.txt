She is something to behold
Elegant and bold
She is electricity
Running to my soul

And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me
Will work each time
Calling me to come back to bed
Singing Georgia on my mind

Lips generous and all
You build me up like steps
Eyes innocent and wild
Remind me what it's like

And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Calling me back into the flames
And I'm burning up again
I'm burning up

And I I never understood what was at stake
Never thought your love was worth it's wait
Well now you've come and gone
I finally worked it out
I worked it out

I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want a trouble in your mind
Won't you let it be

And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Calling me to come back to bed
Singing Georgia on my mind

And I I never understood what was at stake
I never thought your love was worth its wait
Well now you've come and gone
I finally worked it out
I worked it out
