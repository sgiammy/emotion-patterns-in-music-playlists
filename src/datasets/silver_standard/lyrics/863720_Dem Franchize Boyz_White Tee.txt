Yep in my white tee, yup in my white tee
Yep in my white tee, yup in my white tee
Yep in my white tee, yup in my white tee
Yep in my white tee, yup in my white tee
Yep in my white tee, yup in my white tee
Yep in my white tee, yup in my white tee

(Hook: repeat 2X)
I slang in my white tee, I bang in my white tee
All in the club spittin' game in my white tee
I bling in my white tee, serve fiends in my white tee
Fuck a throwback I look clean in my white tee

Step on the scene with some green and some hard white work
Real clean fresh jeans and a all white shirt
We all get money and we all smoke purp'
Hit the dirt one squirt'll leave all y'all murk
'Cause I'm fresh in my white tee, they glance at my white tee
And I got that hat that match my pants and my white tee
Whoever that you might see, I know they got a white tee
Homeboy, brother, sister, mother, daddy or your wifey
Hanes or Fruit of Loom be the name of my white tee
I gotta change man it's a stain on my white tee
Lames in a white tee, I bring the pain in my white tee
Hispanic, cracker, nigga even yangs wearing white tees
Hit the club deep and we all got a white tees
A throwback, no gat, hell naw that don't excite me
You don't need no throwback cause you will be set on your white tee
You can get a circle or a v neck on your white tee

Well I hit the mall in my white tee, oh I think they like me
Or they like them diamonds 'cause they shine so brightly
Yeah you know how I be up under my tee it's that wifey
Fo'fo' tucked tightly for them niggaz who think I'm soft
Nigga come and try me, they gon' find yo' body
White tees in the club and while we drinking on Bacardi
Fuck throwbacks, white tees in party
Now don't get me started, gotta try record it
Bullshit we avoid it
Everyone wear white tees, 'cause they can afford it
Girls wear white tees, boys wear white tees
Niggaz in the trap nigga bet they got a white tee
I wear a white tee, you wear a white tee
The next day catch me with a brand new white tee
Oh that boy there clean, white shoes fresh jeans
But on that boy shirt what it say? Not a thing

I gotta couple throwbacks, it's just I choose not to wear 'em
White tee extravaganza nigga like a Foot Locker sale
Niggaz think I done failed, but my paper stackin a lot
Or you can throw-back this, but partner check my knot
And all my ghetto gangstas white tee, laws gone hate ya
With street game and a little fame them hoes gonna chase ya
Can't escape bro, this white done covered the map
Like crack did in the eighties, it took over the trap
Come to the hood you can find me trapping in my white tee
Standing with a full grill niggaz might try me
So high, I bem still in my white tee
Rock jeans tiger green yeah hoes like me
Haters try to bite me, some try to dislike me
Became a rich nigga and the feds try to indict me

Yep in my white tee
Yep in my white tee
Yep in my white tee
Yep in my white tee
Yep in my white tee
Yep in my white tee
Yep in my white tee
Yep in my white tee
Yep in my white tee
Yep in my white tee
Yep in my white tee
