Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help
Fallin' in love with you
Oh, shall I stay

Would it be a sin
Oh, if I can't help
Fallin' in love with you
Like a river flows

Surely to the sea

Darling so it goes
Some things
Are meant to be
Take my hand

Take my whole life too
Oh, for I can't help
Fallin' in love with you
Oh, like a river flows

Surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Oh, take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help
Fallin' in love with you
Oh, oh, for I, I can't help
Falling in love with you
