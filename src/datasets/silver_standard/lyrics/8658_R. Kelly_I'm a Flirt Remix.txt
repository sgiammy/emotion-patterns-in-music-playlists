I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a flirt

Soon as I see her walk up in the club (I'm a flirt)
Winkin' her eyes at me when I roll up on them dubs (I'm a flirt)
Sometimes when I'm with my chick all alone (I'm a flirt)
And when she's wit' her man lookin' at me, damn right (I'm a flirt)
So homie don't bring your girl to me because (I'm a flirt)
And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat 'cause (I'm a flirt)
Please believe it unless your game is tight and you trust her
Then, don't bring her around me because (I'm a flirt)

Now swear to tell the truth and the whole truth
When it comes to hoes I be pimpin' like I supposed to
Rollin' like I supposed to, shinin' like I supposed to
In the club, fuckin' wit' honeys like I supposed to
I don't understand when a nigga bring his girlfriend to the club
Freakin' all on the floor wit' his girlfriend in the club
And wonder why all these playas tryna holla at her
Just soon as you go to the bathroom nigga I'mma holla at her
A dog on the prawl when I'm walkin' through the mall
If I could man I probably would flirt wit' all y'all
Yeah yeah homie you say she ya girlfriend
But when I step up to her I'mma be like cousin
Believe me man, this is how them playas do it in the Chi'
And plus we got them player-ette flirters in the Chi'
Now the moral of the story is cuff yo bitch, 'cause hey
I'm black, handsome, I sing, plus I'm rich, and (I'm A Flirt)

Aye homie if you ain't gettin' no money
You better keep her away from me ya dig

Well if you love ya girl, and wanna keep ya girl
Don't be walkin' up and askin' me to meet your girl
'Cause I'm well enough flirt when I speak to a girl
She winked her eyes on the slide, I sent you girl
Better treat your girl right 'cause another man will
Better eat ya girl like another man will
'Cause you leave your wife, and I see ya wife
That be for real, how long you think that's finna be ya wife
Well I'm livin' the life, you just gettin' it right
Your old lady look at me 'cause you ain't hittin' it right
She probably used to like you 'cause you the bitter type
That's until I came along and put some dick in her life
Wanna see how that ass look with a dick in her life
I noticed she was checkin' me and diggin' the ice
And if I get that tonight better hit that twice
I can even make her mine if I hit that right
Ya know, smack that thang, sit that right
Up on the dresser yeah that's right
Pullin' on her hair like we gettin' in a fight
Yeah I know it's kinda tight but it'll suit her just right
So if ya girl sexy, and she test me
Don't be upset G 'cause you might catch me
Tryna to catch a glance up her skirt, put the Mclaren in reverse
Then if I see her and I like her then I'mma flirt

Lets Go Y'all!

When I (uh), when I (uh), when I (uh),
When I pull up to the club, all the shawties be like (Damn 28's)
Then I be like girl you know just who I (am don't hate)
See I done fell 'n' luv wit' a stripper y'all
All I do is flirt with her and I get them draws
And I don't need no help I got it down (down pact)

Now I'mma flirt whether I'm in or out of town (the town)
That's why they call me Teddy Penderaz (doun)
