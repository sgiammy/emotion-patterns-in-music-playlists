Can't take me apart

See the light, a new day has arrived for us 
Genesis of our evolution 
A linchpin holds within a means to an end
Can't you see that we are one? 

Can't take me apart
No, you can't! 

We see no end to the dream 

We will never see the end
We will never be the end 
All my life, I've felt discarded 
Never feeling a part of it 

No, you can't! 

Without me you will fade, you will not remain
We are one, and of the same future machine
A linchpin holds within a means to an end
Can't you see that we are one? 

Can't take me apart
No, you can't!

We see no end to the dream

We will never see the end
We will never be the end
All my life, I've felt discarded
Never feeling a part of it

No, you can't take me apart

You can't change me now
