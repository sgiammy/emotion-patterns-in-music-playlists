I don't know what's happening
Palpitations of
White is snow
And the coffee's on
Maturation of
All you remember
All your secret doorways
Battle's not with flesh and blood
White is snow

My good fortune
I never came across a spark worth faking
I should have told you
I never really had a heart for the taking
Like a cartoon
I tried to pull your head the other way around
