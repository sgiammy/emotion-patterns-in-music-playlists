Yo, remember back on the bully when cats used to harmonize like 
"Wooo... wooo... wooo..."
Yo, yo, my men and my women, don't forget about the Deen
The Sirat al-Mustaqim, yo
It's about a thing
Yo, yo, yo, if you feel real good, lift your hands up in the air
And lick two shots in the atmosphere
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you and him then give him a little trim

To begin, how you think you really goin' to pretend
Like you wasn't down when you called him again?
Plus when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably [fuck] again

Talking out your neck, saying you're a Christian
A Muslim sleeping with the Jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who're you going to tell when the repercussions spin?

Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock, when you really are a gem

Baby girl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending him
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament

Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn
It's silly when girls sell their souls because of sin
Look at what you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans, come again

Yo! A-when when come again (yeah yeah)
When when come again (yeah yeah)
My friend come again (yeah yeah)

Guys you know you'd better, watch out
Some girls, some girls are only, about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Tims than his women
Him and his men, come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend, popping yin (Like you got Yen)

Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by the waist men
Cristal by the case men, still living in his mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they be the big men
Need to take care of their three and four kids

But they face a court case when the child support's late
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky silent men, the punk domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men

How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?
Unh unh come again
Yo yo come again
Brethren come again
Sistren come again

Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out

Girls you know you'd better, watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

Guys you know you'd better, watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

Girls you know you'd better, watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing
