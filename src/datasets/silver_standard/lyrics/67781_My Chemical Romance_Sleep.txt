There, there're these terrors, and it's like
It feels like as if somebody was gripping my
There're these terrors and it's like
It feels like as if somebody was gripping my throat

…ight, uh, they're not like tremors
They're worse than tremors, there're, there're these terrors
Like last night, uh, they're not like tremors
They're worse than tremors, there're, there're these terrors

And it's like
It feels like as if somebody was gripping my throat
And squeezing and
And it feels like as if somebody was gripping my throat

Some say now suffer all the children
And walk away a savior
Or a madman and polluted
From gutter institutions
Don't you breathe for me
Undeserving of your sympathy
'Cause there ain't no way that I'm sorry
For what I did

And through it all
How could you cry
For me?
'Cause I don't feel bad about it
So shut your eyes
Kiss me goodbye
And sleep
Just sleep

The hardest part
Is letting go of
Your dreams

A drink
For the horror that I'm in
For the good guys and the bad guys
For the monsters that I've been
Three cheers for tyranny
Unapologetic apathy
'Cause there ain't no way that I'm coming
Back again

And through it all
How could you cry
For me?
'Cause I don't feel bad about it
So shut your eyes
Kiss me goodbye
And sleep
Just sleep

The hardest part's
The awful things that
I've seen

Sometimes I see flames
And sometimes I see people that I love dying
And it's always
Sometimes I see flames
And sometimes I see people that I love dying
And it's always

Just sleep
Just sleep
Just sleep
Just sleep
Just sleep
Just sleep

(Wake up)
(Wake up)
(Wake up)
(Wake up)
(Wake up)
(Wake up)
(Wake up…)

And I can't, I can't ever wake up
