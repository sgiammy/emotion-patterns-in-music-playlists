In the days of my youth
I was told what it means to be a man
And now I've reached that age
I've tried to do all those things the best I can
No matter how I try
I find my way to the same old jam

Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown-eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

Sixteen, I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be
It only took a couple of days till she was rid of me
She swore that she would be all mine and love me till the end
But when I whispered in her ear, I lost another friend, oh

Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown-eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown-eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

I know what it means to be alone
I sure do wish I was at home
I don't care what the neighbors say
I'm gonna love you each and every day

You can feel the beat within my heart
Realize, sweet babe, we ain't never gonna part
I feel good when I look into your eyes.
