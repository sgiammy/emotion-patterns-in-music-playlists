Get loose and move your body, we crankin' up the volume

I bought the bar, I bought the ho' so a nigga can't tell me shit
Just pour up the Ace, that cheap shit makes me sick
I even let your bitch keep the gold bottle, gold pack, no Lifestyle
Came to the club with my dogs, yeah we gon' ball 'til we fall
OG kush on me, Steve Urkel have a young nigga geeked
These girls, they DTF, that train got 'em feelin' theirself
This nightlife shit ain't new to me
Al the bad bitches get loose for me
Say you do this every night, you gotta prove it to me
Say you 'bout that life, you gotta prove it to me

Shots, shots, now let's fuckin' party
Shots, shots, now let's fuckin' party
Shots, shots, now let's fuckin' party
Shots, shots, now let's fuckin' party

Rockstar life, fuck who don't like it
Party all night, party all night
I came here to have a good time
Good smoke, good vibes, it's the good life
Somehow I got the sack past security
Now I'm jumpin' up and down off the Hennessy
Now I'm jumpin' up and down off the Hennessy
I'll probably wake up in the mornin' with no memory
Double shots, no chaser
We party hard in the AM
Safe sex, no babies
Everybody get wasted

Chug, chug, chug
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Don't stop 'til you get enough

Chug, chug, chug
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Don't stop 'til you get enough
