I live for the night, I live for the lights
I live for the high 'til I'm free fallin'
I live for the night, I live for the lights
I live for the high 'til I'm free fallin' (fallin', fallin', fallin'...)
'Til I'm free fallin' (fallin')

I live for the night

I am tryna holla, got that ink up on my collar
Drink until it's nada, isn't whiskey, I don't bother
My bitches ain't no dimes, they be mothafuckin' dollars
So we stack our drinks up high, skyscrapin' 'til we taller
Ring ring, hit that up, show that universal love
If you bleed that red blood, dance until you get enough
Ring ring, hit that up, show that universal love
If you bleed that red blood, dance until you get enough

I'mma do what I want, whatever
I'mma rage 'til the dawn, all-nighter
Don't hold your breath
You know I'll sleep when I am dead

I live for the night, I live for the lights
I live for the high 'til I'm free fallin'
I live for the night, I live for the lights
I live for the high 'til I'm free fallin' (fallin')
I live for the night
Free fallin'

I'm the Grim Reaper when I'm blarin' out your speaker
Killin' off the weaker, welcome to the final feature
My head is in the clouds, you can say that I'm a dreamer
But I bang it super loud, turn that bitch into a screamer

I'mma do what I want, whatever
I'mma rage 'til the dawn, all-nighter
Don't hold your breath
You'll know I'll sleep when I am dead

I live for the night, I live for the lights
I live for the high 'til I'm free fallin'
I live for the night, I live for the lights
I live for the high 'til I'm free fallin' (falling, falling, falling...)

I live for the night, I live for the lights
I live for the high 'til I'm free fallin'
I live for the night, I live for the lights
I live for the high 'til I'm free fallin' (falling, falling, falling...)

I live for the night
