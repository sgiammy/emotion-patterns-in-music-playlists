Let's drop!
Yeah
Come on (shake, shake)

I'll take you home if you don't leave me at the front door
Your body's cold, but girl we're getting so warm
And I was thinking of ways that I could get inside (get inside)
So now you're falling in love (let me go now)
This feeling's turning me on (here we go now)

Now if she does it like this, will you do it like that
Now if she touches like this, will you touch her right back
Now if she moves like this, will you move her like that
Come on, shake, shake, shake, shake, a-shake it

Shake, shake, shake, shake, a-shake it
Shake, shake, shake, shake, a-shake it
Shake, shake, shake, shake, a-shake it
Shake, shake, shake, shake, a-shake it

Your lips tremble but your eyes are in a straight stare
We're on the bed, but your clothes are laying right there
And I was thinking of places that I could hide (I could hide)
So now you're falling in love (let me go now)
This feeling's turning me on (here we go now)

Now if she does it like this, will you do it like that
Now if she touches like this, will you touch her right back
Now if she moves like this, will you move her like that
Come on, shake, shake, shake, shake, a-shake it

Shake, shake, shake, shake, a-shake it
Shake, shake, shake, shake, a-shake it
Shake, shake, shake, shake, a-shake it
Shake, shake, shake, shake, a-shake it

I saw you dancing and I couldn't get you off my mind
I could tell that you could tell that I was taking my time
I was thinking of ways that you would stay and be mine
You're body's shaking, turn me on, so I can turn off the lights

Now if she does it like this, will you do it like that
Now if she touches like this, will you touch her right back
Now if she moves like this, will you move her like that
Come on, shake, shake, shake, shake, a-shake it

Shake, shake, shake, shake, a-shake it
Shake, shake, shake, shake, a-shake it
Shake, shake, shake, shake, a-shake it
Shake, shake, shake, shake, a-shake it

Shake, shake, shake, shake, a-shake it
Shake, shake, shake, shake, a-shake it
Shake, shake, shake, shake, a-shake it
Shake, shake, shake, shake, a-shake it
