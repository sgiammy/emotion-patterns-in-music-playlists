Oh and I overdose
Boy I want off this roller coaster
You take me high just to bring me down
Oh, and you bring me down, down

I'm trying not to take too much
I'm in over my head
Over love, boy I over trust
Give me the chance to pick up the pieces you left me in
Why did I let you in?
Overzealous, I'm over this
Oh I'm over us
Over and over
I let you under my skin and it's over
I promise never again you'd come over
Something takes over me
I can't control this hallucinogen

Oh and I overdose
Boy I want off this roller coaster
You take me high just to bring me down
Oh, and you bring me down

Oh and I overdose
Boy I want off this roller coaster
You take me high just to bring me down
Oh, and you bring me down

We fight, we laugh
Detox, rehab
Letting go of what we had
Oh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Over trying
Over lies
Over crying
Over-traumatized
Over-worked and moreover I'm done
Over and over
I'm falling under your spell, call me over
I'm runnin' back to this hell you come over
And didn't you say we were through?
Why can't I get over you?

Oh and I overdose
Boy I want off this roller coaster
You take me high just to bring me down
Oh, and you bring me down

Oh and I overdose
Boy I want off this roller coaster
You take me high just to bring me down
Oh, and you bring me down

Boy I come crashing, crashing
Down from the high and wondering, wondering
Wondering why this ain't over
Let it just be over
Sobering thoughts taking over my mind

Oh and I overdose
Boy I want off this roller coaster
You take me high just to bring me down
Oh, and you bring me down
Oh and I overdose
Boy I want off this roller coaster
You take me high just to bring me down
Oh, and you bring me down
