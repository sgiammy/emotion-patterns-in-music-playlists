Another shot of whisky, please, bartender
Keep it coming 'til I don't remember at all
How bad it hurts when you're gone (na na na)

Turn the music up a little bit louder
Just gotta get past the midnight hour (uh huh)
Maybe tomorrow it won't
Be
This
Hard
Who am I kidding?
I know what I'm missing

You
I had my heart set on you
But nothing else hurts like you do
Who knew that love was so cruel
(Yeah yeah yeah)
And I
Waited and waited so long
For someone to never come home
It's my fault to think you'll be true (yeah yeah)
I'm just a fool
(Yeah)

I said that I don't care
I'd walk away whatever
And I tell myself we were bad together (uh huh)
But that's just me trying to move on
With
Out
You
But who am I kidding?
I know what I'm missing

Hey
I had my heart set on you
But nothing else hurts like you do
Who know that love was so cruel
(Yeah yeah yeah)
And I
Waited and waited so long
For someone who never comes home
It's my fault to think you'll be true (yeah yeah)
I'm just a fool

For holding on to something that
Is never ever gonna come back
I can't accept that it's lost

I should have let it go
Held my tongue
Can't fight the motion
Cause now everything's so wrong
I'm thrown

I'm just a fool
A fool for you
I'm just a fool

I had my heart set on you
And nothing else hurts like you do
Who knew that love was so cruel
(Yeah yeah yeah)
And I
Waited and waited so long
For someone who never comes home
It's my fault to think you'll be true (yeah yeah)
I'm just a fool
I'm just a fool
I'm just a fool

It's my fault to think you'll be true
(Yeah yeah yeah)
I'm just a fool
