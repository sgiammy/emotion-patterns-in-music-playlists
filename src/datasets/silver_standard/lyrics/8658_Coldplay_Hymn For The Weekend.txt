Oh angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up...

Life is a drink and love's a drug
Oh now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood

You said 'drink from me, drink from me'
When I was so thirsty
Poured on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low low low low

I oh I oh II oh...
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high so high
Oh I oh I oh I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high so high...

Oh angel sent from up above
I feel you coursing through my blood
Life is a drink, your love's about
To make the stars come out

Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low low low low...

I oh I oh I...
You got me feeling drunk and high
So high so high
Oh I oh I oh I...
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high so high

I oh I oh I...
La la la la la la la
So high so high

Oh I oh I oh I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high so high
That I shoot across the sky
That I shoot across the
That I shoot across the sky
Watch me shoot across the...
