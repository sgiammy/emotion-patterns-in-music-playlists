I shout these words to those who never listened
I pen this letter with the utmost conviction
It's been dark in here, cold and relentless
It's been too long, I can no longer fight this

Too late to change my mind
Nothing remains
I've silenced the pain

All these years past
No one heard true feelings
You continued to act like you knew me
Did you ever stop to think that I'd be able
To look in your eyes and say that I'm stable

Too late to change my mind
Nothing remains
I've silenced the pain

Don't tell me that I am taking the easy way out
Don't tell me that I am taking the easy way out

No

No underlying message to figure out
What you got from me is what I put out
What you got from me is what I put out

No one knew a thing about me
Just longing to be accepted
Wait till you see what I've become
My lifelessness
My lifelessness

Too late to change my mind
Nothing remains
I've silenced the pain
