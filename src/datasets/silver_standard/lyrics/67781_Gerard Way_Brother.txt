Does anyone have the time to bring me down?
And can I sleep all night long to the drums of the city rain?
Just make it up
'Cause I'm awake all night long to the drums of the city rain

And brother if you have the chance to pick me up?
And can I sleep on your couch to the pound of the ache and pain?
Oh, in my head 'cause I'm awake all night long to the drums of the city rain

The lights we chase
The nights we steal
The things that we take
To make us feel this
I can't go back
Don't think I will
I won't sleep tonight as long as I still
Hear the drums of the city rain

Does anyone have the guts to shut me up?
'Cause I believe that every night
There's a chance we can walk away
So hold on tight
Because I won't wait too long in the drums of the beating rain

'Cause the nights don't last
And we leave alone
Will you drive me back?
Can you take me home?

The lights we chase
The nights we steal
The things that we take
To make us feel this
I can't go back
I don't think I will
I won't sleep tonight as long as I still
Hear the drums of the city rain

Faces I don't know
I am tired in the glow
Of the freezing glow
Keep me breathing don't make the lights come back
Can you take me home?
We all need this when we leave alone

Remember when you and I would make things up?
So many nights, just take me down to the place we could hear them play
I miss that sound
'Cause now we don't sing so loud
To the drums of the city rain

The lights we chase
The nights we steal
The things that we take
To make us feel this
I can't go back
I don't think I will
I won't sleep tonight as long as I still
Hear the drums of the city rain

Like strangers laugh and like subways feel
Things I'm trying to break
Oh, just wait until this is all we have to keep us ill
I won't breathe tonight as long as I still hear the drums of the city rain
