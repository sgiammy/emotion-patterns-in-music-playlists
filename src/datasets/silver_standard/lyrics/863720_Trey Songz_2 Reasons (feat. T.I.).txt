(Trey Songz)
Tell the DJ "turn it up"
Bet the DJ bring it back
Tell him "play that shit again"
Tell him that you like that, like that, oh!

(T.I.)
Trey, I ain't got but two reasons to be here, man
All the bottles, pop them bottles!

(Trey Songz)
A-ha!

I know it's somebody birthday
Right now, right now, right now, right now
Yeah, and somebody getting drunk too
Right now, right now, right now, right now, right now

Catch me in the club like I own that bitch
Shawty dancing like she on that dick
Bad bitches never hold back
Send me a picture, where your phone at?

I only came here for two reasons
I can't lie (what you came for?)

I only came for the bitches and the drinks
Bitches and the drinks, bitches and the drinks
For the bitch, ca-came for the bitches and the drinks
Bitches and the drinks, bitches and the drinks (baby, what you came for?)

(Baby get your glass up) Only came for the bitches and the drinks
(Baby get your ass up) That's what I came for

I see you tryna handcuff her on a sneak
Stop trippin', you can't control that freak
Ain't nobody got a body like hers
Ghetto booty, but she came from the 'burbs

Got a dark-skinned girl dancing on me
Two white girls dancing on me
Bad yellow bone, yeah I'm in my zone
Waitress keep coming back, so you know we hella gone

I only came here for two reasons
I can't lie (what you came for?)

I only came for the bitches and the drinks
Bitches and the drinks, bitches and the drinks
For the bitch, ca-came for the bitches and the drinks
Bitches and the drinks, bitches and the drinks (baby, what you came for?)

(Baby get your glass up) Only came for the bitches and the drinks
(Baby get your ass up) That's what I came for

(T.I.)
I hit the club and buy the bar
In VIP, just see my partners and a lot of broads
And such a G I be, just pop them bottles, party hard
I'm done with today, I'm looking for tomorrow

All I do is turn up
Ain't no dough, it's don't concern us
All this Bubble Kush I burn up
Smell some Regular, it ruined us

Turning corners, fishtailin' out the parking lot
Yellin' "Bankhead", "Westside"
Eight or nine chicks trailin'

Right behind us, been this way since we were minors
If it wasn't for the chicks off in this bitch, you wouldn't find us
Even way out in China, same thing when I came through the door
Like "here you go, there the bitches and the drinks, yo!"

(Trey Songz)
I only came for the bitches and the drinks
Bitches and the drinks, bitches and the drinks
For the bitch, ca-came for the bitches and the drinks
Bitches and the drinks, bitches and the drinks (baby, what you came for?)

(Baby get your glass up) Only came for the bitches and the drinks
(Baby get your ass up) That's what I came for

Hey girl, you heard what I said, get your ass up
You hot, you cold, you Florida, Alaska
Chicago, Virginia, New York City
Houston where the girls all thick

LA, The Bay, tell your girl 'bout this (yeah hey)
Matter of fact, tell the whole GA
Ooh, you know they fine up and down the Carolinas
Shout to every ten I see when I'm down in Tennessee

I only came here for two reasons
I can't lie (what you came for?)

I only came for the bitches and the drinks
