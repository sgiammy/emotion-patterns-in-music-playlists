(Zombie on the track)

Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team fucking here

I done kept it real from the jump
Living at my mama house, we'd argue every mornin', nigga
I was trying to get it on my own
Working all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle calling me like "Where ya at
I gave you the keys, told ya bring it right back, nigga"
I just think it's funny how it goes
Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show
And we

Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga

Boys tell stories about the man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it, nigga
I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much I hear that's poppin' off without us, nigga
We just want the credit where it's due
I'mma worry about me, give a fuck about you, nigga
Just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain even when I'm in the house
'Cause we

Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga

No new niggas, nigga, we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where you real friends at
We don't like to do too much explaining
Story stay the same, I never changed it
No new niggas, nigga, we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where you real friends at
We don't like to do too much explaining
Story stay the same through the money and the fame
'Cause we

Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga
