Don't do
Ear Drummers
Don't do
(Mike WiLL Made It)

Of course I want to lie and say I don't miss you
My bitch on the side just told me to forget you
Quit tellin' the world that I deal with you
That's what niggas do, that's what niggas do
So much for a dream come true
So this is what we've come to?
If you want to go, fuck you

I don't know what it is about these bitches
Maybe it's me listenin' to the radio
Kickin' it with this good dope
That I chose to roll with these bad hoes
And I can't complain
I came up, came up on y'all hoes and I'm not ashamed

Somethin' went wrong, somethin' went wrong
Somethin' went wrong, somethin' went wrong
Somethin' went wrong, terribly wrong
Somethin' went wrong, terribly wrong

Of course I want to lie and say I don't miss you
My bitch on the side just told me to forget you
Quit tellin' the world that I deal with you
That's what niggas do, that's what niggas do
So much for a dream come true
So this is what we've come to?
If you want to go, fuck you

Two middle fingers
It ain't nothin' to forget you
I blocked your number, can't call my phone
And I'm with some other bitches
She a player like me
Try to leave a nigga on E
Had to keep trippin', OD
Bounce back to the old me
I shoulda listened to the homies
Hit it then quit it then went about my fuckin' business
But I was fuckin' with lil momma, that was my decision
And don't really listen to nobody else opinion
Say girl you done with it
But I know you fuck with me
'Cause these other niggas inconsistent
And these other niggas ain't Jxmmi

Of course I want to lie and say I don't miss you
My bitch on the side just told me to forget you
Quit tellin' the world that I deal with you
That's what niggas do, that's what niggas do
So much for a dream come true
So this is what we've come to?
If you want to go, fuck you

Somethin' went wrong, somethin' went wrong
Somethin' went wrong, somethin' went wrong
Somethin' went wrong, terribly wrong
Somethin' went wrong, terribly wrong

Now that I know, now that I know
Now that I know, now that I know
Now that I know, now that I know
Now that I know, now that I know
(Haha, Swae Lee)
I can't love you
I can't love you
