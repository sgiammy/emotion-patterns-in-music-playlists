There is no doubt tonight
I'm falling, I'm falling so
In love with how you are to me
For you I would give anything

Try to be a man
I'm falling, I'm falling so
So far from what I thought was clear
No, there's no turning back from here

Now that we have the world in front of us
We're never turning back
How could we ever not believe?
Now that I have the world in front of me
I'm never turning back
How could I ever let this go?

So many times I fall
I'm falling, I fall apart
I'm so concerned with petty things
It drags me farther down

Why do we run from things we're scared of?
I see it now, it's all so clear
No, there's no turning back from here

Now that we have the world in front of us
We're never turning back
How could we ever not believe?
Now that I have the world in front of me
I'm never turning back
How could I ever let this go? (Let this go)

What are you scared of?
(And if there's nothing left at least I'll know what's left of me)
What are you running from?
(No, there's no looking back, I'm not running)

What is it that you're afraid of?
Tell me, what is it you're running from?

Now that we have the world in front of us
We're never turning back
How could we ever not believe?
Now that I have the world in front of me
I'm never turning back
How could I ever let this go?

I love the thought, I love the thought
What this all could mean
You're the only good thing left in me

Now that I have the world in front of me
I'm never turning back
How could I ever let this go? (Let this go)
