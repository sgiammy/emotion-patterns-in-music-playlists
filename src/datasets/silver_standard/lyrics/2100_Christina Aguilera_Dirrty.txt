Ah, dirrty (Dirrty)
Filthy (Filthy)
Nasty (Christina), you nasty (Yeah)
Too dirrty to clean my act up
If you ain't dirrty
You ain't here to party (Ooh!)

Ladies (Move)
Gentlemen (Move)
Somebody ring the alarm
A fire on the roof

Ring the alarm (And I'm throwin' elbows)
Ring the alarm (And I'm throwin' elbows)
Ring the alarm (And I'm throwin' elbows)
Ring the alarm (And I'm throwin' elbows)

Ring the alarm (And I'm throwin' elbows)
Ring the alarm (And I'm throwin' elbows)
Ring the alarm (And I'm throwin' elbows)

Oh, I'm overdue
Give me some room
I'm comin' through

Paid my dues
In the mood
Me and the girls gonna shake the room

DJ's spinning (Show your hands)
Let's get dirrty (That's my jam)
I need that, uh, to get me off
Sweat'n till my clothes come off

It's explosive, speakers are pumpin'
Still jumping, six in the morning
Table dancing, glasses are crashin'
No question, time for some action

Temperature's up (Can you feel it?)
'Bout to erupt
Gonna get my girls
Get your boys
Gonna make some noise

Wanna get rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty

It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat dripping over my body
Dancing getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time for my arrival

Ah, heat is up
So, ladies, fellas drop your cups

Body's hot
Front to back
Now move your ass
I like that

Tight hip huggers (Low for sure)
Shake a little somethin' (On the floor)
I need that, uh, to get me off
Sweat'n until my clothes come off

Let's get open, cause a commotion
We're still going, eight in the morning
There's no stopping, we keep it popping
Hot rocking, everyone's talking

Give all you got (Give it to me)
Just hit the spot
Gonna get my girls
Get your boys
Gonna make some noise

Rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty

It's about time that I came to start the party
Ooh, sweat dripping over my body
Dancing getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time for my arrival

Here it comes, it's the one
You've been waiting on
Get up, get it up
Yup, that's what's up
Giving just what you want
To the maximum
Uh oh, here we go (Here we go)

You can tell when the music
Starts to drop
That's when we take it
To the parking lot
And I bet you somebody's
Gonna call the cops
Uh oh's, here we go's (Here we go)

Oh ooh oh, yeah yeah...

Yo, hot damn, doc a jam like a summer show
I keep my car looking like a crash dummy drove
My gear look like the bank got my money froze
For dead presidents I pimp like huddy roll
Doc the one that excite ya divas
If the media shine
I'm shining with both of the sleeves up
Yo, Christina, better hop in here
My block live and in color, like Rodman hair (Yeah)

The club is packed, the bar is filled
I'm waiting for sister to act, like Lauryn Hill
Frankly, it's a rap, no bargain deals
I drive a four wheel ride with foreign wheels
Throw it up

Baby it's brick city, you heard of that
We blessed, and hung low, like Bernie Mac
Dogs, let 'em out, women, let 'em in
It's like I'm ODB, the way I'm freaking

Wanna get rowdy (Rowdy, yeah)
Gonna get a little unruly (Ruly)
Get it fired up in a hurry (Hurry)
Wanna get dirrty

It's about time that I came to start the party (Party)
Sweat dripping over my body (Body)
Dancing getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time for my arrival

Rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty

It's about time that I came to start the party
Ooh, sweat dripping over my body
Dancing getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time for my arrival

Rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Let's get dirrty

It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat dripping over my body
Dance and getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time for my arrival

Uh, what?
