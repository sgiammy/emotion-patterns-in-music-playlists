You don't want zero problems, big fella

If one more label try to stop me

You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, bi'h

Ooh, watch me come and put the hinges in their hands
Countin' Benjis while we meetin', make 'em shake my other hand, wuh
Milly rockin', scoopin' all the blessings on my lap
Bitch, I know you tried to cheat, you shoulda never took a nap, hey

Fuck wrong with you, what you were thinkin'
Fuck you thought it was
You talk that talk, that nigga lame, that nigga fall in love
Not me, no, bitch, you can keep those
Bruh, I'm at your head like Craig did Deebo
Don't tweak, bro, it's never sweet, oh
My shooters come for free, so

If one more label try to stop me

2 Chainz
You old Petey Pablo, take your shirt off
Wave round your head like a helicopter
I ain't put enough weed in the blunt
All you do is smoke tobacco
Where the hell you get them from
Yeezy said he ain't make them
My niggas chasin' bounty hunters
And gettin' chased by their baby mommas
My first tat was on my stomach
Got a pocket full of money
And a mind full of ideas
Some of this shit may sound weird
Inside of the Maybach
Look like it came out of Ikea
Run shit like diarrhea
Big yacht, no power steering
Aye, aye, captain
I'm high, captain
I'm so high
Me and God dappin'
This is my blessin'
This is my passion
School of hard knocks
I took night classes

Chance
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, yuh
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me, hahaha
Yep, yep
Pull up in the new thing, I'm like
They be like, "There he go!"

I got problems bigger than these boys, yeah
My deposits, they be on steroids, Lord
Free the Carter, niggas need the Carter
Sacrificin' everything, I feel like Jesus Carter
Hold up, I got this sewed up, my soda poured up
My woes up, I'm flippin' those bucks, they doing the toe tucks
I rolled up and let the smoke puff
I lay down toes up
Hold up, get too choked up when I think of old stuff
Move on, put my goons on, they kidnap newborns
In the streets my face a coupon
Her pussy too warm
All these bitches come to do harm
Just bought a new charm
Fuck the watch, I buy you a new arm, you lukewarm
I'm Uncle Luke with the hoes
Pretty bitches, centerfolds
Tippy toes around my crib in their robes, just their robes
Half a milli in the safe, another in the pillowcase
Codeine got me movin' slower than a caterpillar race
Fuck wrong with you, what you were thinkin'?
What you thought it was
I just popped five Percocets and only caught a buzz
And if that label try to stop me
There gon' be some crazy Weezy fans waitin' in the lobby
Mula, baby

Chance
You don't want no problem, want no problem with me
