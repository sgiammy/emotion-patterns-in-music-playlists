It's say yeah
One night in town
My niggas round
Throwin' money
Them bitches hit the ground
Then bring it back up
She bringin' backup
Put 'em in that black truck
So many hoes they lapped up
My niggas leanin
Diddy boppin
Let's get it poppin'
I said let's get it poppin'
Just look at how she drop it
Lil mama a certified pro
She need her own show
Slide on down that pole and grind slow
Hell no I ain't countin' my dough
I came to blow it all
And get some brains trynna find miss know it all
And I got my cup filled you see how them bucks peel
Young pimp see how grab me up and chicken just chill

In the back of the club
With a stack full a dubs
Drop it low like a pro
Bring it back that's what's up
All my dogs up in here
Plus there's hoes everywhere
Niggas stunt like you don't care
Throw that money in the air and say yeah (yeah)
Throw that money in one hand and say yeah
Throw that money in the air and say yeah (yeah)
Throw that money in one hand and say yeah
Throw that money in the air and say yeah (yeah)

I'm high and drunk doin' my same dance
They call it pocahontas doin' that rain dance
Talkin' dough I got it so make it rain man
Cause tha flow retarded sorta like that rain man
Borderline insane man
Look at all these dames damn
When a nigga gettin' money
And I'm a changed man
You smell that haze scent
Know my gameplan
Trynna get it smackin
I ain't with dat gameplan
Lil momma work for every dollar she drop it low
Pop it slow stop and go
Lots of smoke we keep 'em rollin' up
Shorty mad she came with you
She wanna roll with us

And say yeah
And say yeah
And say yeah

I said listen here
I do it broad day
All day
Smokin' on that bomb hay
And I got my cup filled you see how them bucks peel
Young pimp see how grab me up and chicken just chill
