Come stop your crying
It will be alright
Just take my hand
Hold it tight
I will protect you
From all around you
I will be here
Don't you cry

For one so small
You seem so strong
My arms will hold you
Keep you safe and warm
This bond between us
Can't be broken
I will be here don't you cry

'Cause you'll be in my heart
Yes, you'll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and for evermore
You'll be in my heart
No matter what they say
You'll be here in my heart
Always

Why can't they understand
The way we feel
They just don't trust
What they can't explain
I know we're different
But deep inside us
We're not that different at all

And you'll be in my heart
Yes, you'll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and for evermore

Don't listen to them
'Cause what do they know?
We need each other
To have, to hold
They'll see in time
I know

And destiny calls you
You must be strong
I may not be with you
But you've got to hold on
They'll see in time
I know
We'll show them together

'Cause you'll be in my heart (Believe me)
Yes, you'll be in my heart (I'll be there)
From this day on
Now and for evermore

Oh, you'll be in my heart (You'll be here in my heart)
No matter what they say (I'll be with you)
You'll be here in my heart
I'll be there always

Always
I'll be with you
Well, I'll be there for you always
Always and always
Just look over your shoulder
Just look over your shoulder
Just look over your shoulder
I'll be there always
