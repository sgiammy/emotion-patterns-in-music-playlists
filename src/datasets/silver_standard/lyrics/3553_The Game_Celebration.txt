Nigga blowing on that ayo, breakin' down them trees
I'm out the door with dro on the keys
Scooping up Chris and I'm hitting the freeway
Yeah, got a whole zip of that purp
Got a couple bitches home with no clothes on
'Cause they roll on us, twerk
Now we hot boxing that Ghost, Ace all in that door
Ray Bans in my face, never know when my eyes low
Smoke good, fuck good, eat good, stay?
She said backwoods, kill switches, you eat take out
Yeah, but I love fucking that redbone
She country thick and that hair long, that pussy killer, she dead wrong
She went to Howard, her head strong, her momma taught her, her legs long
She went to college and got a masters, now she bringing that bread home
Roll up

Put the purp in the blunt
Get high, get high, get high, get high, get high
Put the purp in the blunt
Westside, westside, westside, westside, westside

It's a celebration, all on the pole doing your dance
Anticipating I'm feeling your body, hoping that you would just give me a chance
God damn babe, just hold your glass up for this toast
My cash up and your ass up, and I'm the ones tipping the most
Tonight, on the westside
And if you wanna roll, have the best night of your life, no lie, no lie
Me and you together girl I'm celebrating you tonight

Uh, yeah I'm blown no cigarillo, rello
Loving like Mello, get on my level 101 carats in my bezel
I'm on, like soon as the ice cream truck at the ghetto
Little knucklehead always in trouble soon as I ask shawty her number, fo sho
Yeah I get it, then I bone, then I hit it like bone bone
Now you fucking up my zone, my zone, my zone
Said she wait for daddy come home
Told me she ain't got nothing on
I'm talking no thong, th-thong, thooong
Yeah she throwing that dick back
Hard as a back, sit on my lap
Fucking with me, ain't nothing better than that
That's a fact, that's a fact
Don't act Hollywood 'cause I don't act
Bout my business but I don't slack
This my celebration rap, so

We havin' a celebration, love to stay high
We havin' a celebration, love to stay high
We havin' a celebration, love to stay high

I pour up for Pimp C, light up for Soulja Slim
Straight out the gutter, with the rest of the bowling pins
Money for days, bitches go both ways
On the road to riches, bitch I got road rage
Got the kush in the swisher, got the pussy, the liquor
Got a silencer on the gun, take it off like a stripper
Yeah, wake up, wake up, I'm going at your face make up
These niggas need stitches 'cause they taking pay cuts
Man somebody tell them hoes it's a celebration
All my niggas got guns no registration
Now go an' light that weed up, I'm Trukfit tee'd up
Hoes down, B's up

Rollin' and chokin' and movin' slow motion, I'm floatin' I'm gone
Rollin' and chokin' and movin' slow motion, I'm floatin' I'm gone

We havin' a celebration, love to stay high
We havin' a celebration, love to stay high
We havin' a celebration, love to stay high
We havin' a celebration, love to stay high
