Eve:
Uh, uh, uh, huh
Yo, yo
Drop your glasses, shake your asses
Face screwed up like you havin' hot flashes

Which one, pick one, this one, classic
Red from blonde, yeah bitch I'm drastic
Why this, why that, lips stop askin'
Listen to me baby, relax and start passin'

Expressway, head back, weavin' through the traffic
This one strong should be labeled as a hazard
Some of y'all niggas hot, sike I'm gassin'
Clowns I spot 'em and I can't stop laughin'
Easy come, easy go, E-V gon' be lastin'

Jealousy, let it go, results could be tragic
Some of y'all ain't writin well, too concerned with fashion
None of you ain't Gisell, cat walk and imagine
Alotta y'all Hollywood, drama, passed it
Cut bitch, camera off, real shit, blast it

Gwen Stefani:
And if I had to give you more,
It's only been a year
Now I got my foot through the door
And I ain't goin' nowhere

It took a while to get me here
And I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear
Now let me blow ya mind

Eve:
They wanna bank up, crank up, makes me dizzy
Shank up, haters wanna come after me
You ain't a gangster, prankster, too much to eat
Snakes in my path wanna smile up at me

Now why you grittin' your teeth?
Frustration, baby, you gotta breathe
Take a lot more than you to get rid of me
You see I do what they can't do, I just do me
Ain't no stress when it comes to sayin' "Get what you see."
Meet me in the lab, pen and pad, don't believe?

Huh, sixteen's mine, create my own lines
Love for my wordplay that's hard to find
Sophomore, I ain't scared, one of a kind
All I do is contemplate ways to make your fans mine
Eyes bloodshot, stressin', chills up your spine
Huh, sick to your stomach, wishin' I wrote your rhymes

Gwen Stefani:
And if I had to give you more,
It's only been a year
Now I got my foot through the door
And I ain't goin' nowhere

It took a while to get me here
And I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear
Now let me blow ya mind

Eve:
Let your bones crack
Your back pop, I can't stop
Excitement, block shots from your stash box
Fuck it, thugged out, I respect the cash route
Locked down, blastin, sets while I mash out

Yeah nigga, mash out, D-R-E
Back track, think back, E-V-E
Do you like that (ooh), you got to I know you
Had you in a trance first glance from the floor, too

Don't believe I'll show you, take you with me
Turn you on, pension gone, give you relief
Put your trust in a bomb when you listen to me
Damn, she much thinner know now I'm complete (Uh-huh)

Still stallion, brick house, pile it on
Ryde or Die bitch, double R, came strong
Beware, 'cause I crush anything I land on
Me here, ain't no mistake, nigga, it was planned on

Gwen Stefani:
And if I had to give you more,
It's only been a year
Now I got my foot through the door
And I ain't goin' nowhere

It took a while to get me here
And I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear
Now let me blow ya mind
