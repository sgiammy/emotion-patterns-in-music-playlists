(Spoken)
LISTEN TO THIS TRACK BITCH!
(Roscoe Dash)
Girl the way you're movin'
Got me in a trance
DJ turn me up
Ladies dis yo jam
I'ma sip Moscato
And you 'gon lose dem pants
Then I'ma throw this money
While you do it with no hands
Girl drop it to the flo'
I love the way yo booty go
All I want to do is sit back
And watch you move
And I'll proceed to throw this cash

(Waka Flocka Flame)

All that ass
In yo jeans
Can Wale beet?
Can Roscoe skeet?
Long hair she don't care
When she walk she get stares
Brown skin or a yellow-bone
DJ this my favorite song
So I'ma make it thunderstorm
Flood warning, Flocka yeah
Blowin' fuck it I don't care
Dreads is flyin' everywhere
Tap my partner Roscoe, like bruh
I'm drunk as hell, can't you tell?
Threw 70 bands, bet 50 stacks
Oh fuckin' well
I'm tryna hit the hotel
With 2 girls that swallow me
Take this dick while I'm swallow
Moscato got her freaky
Hey you got me in a trance
Please take off yo pants
Pussy pop on her handstand
You got me sweatin'
Please pass me a fan, damn!

(Wale)
She said look ma no hands
She said look ma no hands
And no darling, I don't dance
And, I'm with Roscoe, I'm with Waka
I think I deserve a chance
I'm a bad motha-fucka
Gon' ask some mothafuckas
A young handsome mothafucka
I sling that wood
I just nunchuck 'em
And, who you wit
And, what's yo name
You not hip boo, I'm Wale
And, that D.C. shit I rep all day
And, my eyes red 'cause of all that haze
Don't blow my high
Let me shine
Drumma on the beat
Let me take my time
Nigga want beef we can take it outside
Fight for what broad
These hoes ain't mine
Is you out yo mind?
You out yo league
I sweat no bitches
Just sweat out weaves
Wear out tracks
Let me do my thing
I got 16, for this Roscoe thing
But, I'm almost done
Let me get back to it
Whole lotta loud
And a little backwood
Whole lotta money
Big tip I would
I put her on the train
Little engine could, bitch

R-O-S-C-O-E- Mr.Shawty put it on me
I be goin' ham
Shawty upgrade from bologna
Them niggas tippin' good
Girl but I can make it flood
'Cause I walk around
With pockets that are bigger than my bus
Rain, rain go away
That's what all my haters say
My pockets stuck on overload
My rain never evaporates
No need to elaborate
Most of these ducks exaggerate
But, I'ma get money nigga
Everyday stuntin' nigga
Ducks might get a chance after me
Bitch I'm ballin'
Like I'm comin' off of free throws
'Cause the head of the game
No cheat codes
Lambo, Roscoe
No street code
And your booty got me lost like Nemo
Go, go, go
G-gon' and do yo dance
And, I'ma throw this money
While you do it wit no hands

Girl the way you're movin'
Got me in a trance
