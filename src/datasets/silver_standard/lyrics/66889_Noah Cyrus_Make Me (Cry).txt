I never needed you like I do right now
I never needed you like I do right now
I never hated you like I do right now
('Cause all you ever do is make me)

Gave you up 'bout 21 times
Felt those lips tell me 21 lies (yeah)
You'll be the death of me
Sage advice
Love, lovin' you could make Jesus cry

When I hear you sayin', "Darlin'
Your kiss is like an antidote"
I'm fightin' like I'm Ali
But you got me on the ropes

I never needed you like I do right now
I never needed you like I do right now
I never hated you like I do right now
'Cause all you ever do is make me...

Couldn't hear the thunder
But I heard your heart race
Couldn't see the rain
We're too busy makin' hurricanes (yeah)
Love ain't easy when it ain't my way
But it gets hard, when you ain't here makin' me crazy

Baby, say the word, darlin'
You know just how to hold the sucker down
So I'll see you in the morning
I can't watch you walk out

I never needed you like I do right now
I never needed you like I do right now
I never hated you like I do right now
'Cause all you ever do is make me

Cry
Cry
Cry

Hear the thunder, see the rain
Yeah
Keep on makin' me cry
Yeah
Hey, hey yeah
Keep makin' me scream and holler
Keep on makin' me cry
You don't know what you do to me
Hey, hey, yeah
Yeah

I never needed you like I do right now
I never needed you like I do right now
I never hated you like I do right now
'Cause all you ever do is make me
