I cannot spend another night in this home
I close my eyes and take a breath real slow
The consequence is if I leave, I'm alone
But what's the difference when you beg for love?

I run through glass in the street (Kerosene hearts)
Carry the name that my father gave me
And take the face of the wolf

'Cause this is a wasteland, my only retreat
With heaven above you, there's hell over me

I met a girl who never looked so alone
Like sugar water in your mouth, lukewarm
She tied a cherry stem for me with her tongue 
We fell in love and now we're both alone

'Cause I don't need any more friends
And another kiss like a fire on pavement 
We'll burn it down to the end

Th-th-this is a wasteland, my only retreat
With heaven above you, there's hell over me
The water is rusted, the air is unclean
And there for a second I feel fine
This is a wasteland, my only retreat

(Don't be scared)

I've waited all this night to honor you
And say, "I know it's hard, but who are you to
Fall apart on me, on me?"

(This is a wasteland, my only retreat)
(With heaven above you, there's hell over me)

'Cause this is a wasteland, my only retreat
With heaven above you, there's hell over me
You said, "What about us?", well, what about me?
I came from the gallows, I sleep in the rain
'Cause this is a wasteland, my only retreat

(Paralyze me, don't let me go, don't let me fall)
