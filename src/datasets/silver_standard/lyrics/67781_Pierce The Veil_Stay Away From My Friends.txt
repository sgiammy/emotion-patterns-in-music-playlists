Waking up your neighbors downstairs
I've been inside your bedroom a thousand years.
And as you tie me to the bed for good I say,
That I want you in the most unromantic ways.
Louisiana, You're torturing me with a beautiful face.
Ana come on, I thought we had a damn good thing.
A penny in the couch and a diamond ring.

So, baby, stay away from my friends.
'Cause I need them to carry me when it's over.
I'll count back from ten and you can listen to glass hearts shattering.

I don't know how you got into me
Down my throat and made a home in my veins
They used to be the rivers that would take us away.
But now you only call me every Christmas and my birthday.
I still can't believe how you look next to me.
Just like a strip club bedroom scene.

Baby, stay away from my friends.
'Cause I need them to carry me when it's over.
I'll count back from ten and you can
Listen to something that you've never heard before.
Oh, never heard before.
Oh, never heard before.

But you don't know what it's like to wake up in the middle of the night.
Scaring the thought of kissing razors.
This blood evacuation is telling me to cave in, stay away,
Oh no, Just stay away from my friends.
