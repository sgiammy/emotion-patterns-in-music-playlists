Stained coffee cup
Just a fingerprint of lipstick's not enough
Sleep, where you lay
Still a trace of innocence on pillow case

Waking up
Beside you I am a loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours I got no control
No control
Powerless
And I don't care it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down my eyes are closed
No control

Taste on my tongue
I don't want a wash away the night before
In the heat where you lay
I could stay right here and burn in it all day

Waking up
Beside you I am a loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours I got no control
No control
Powerless
And I don't care it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down my eyes are closed
No control

Lost my senses
I'm defenseless
Her perfume's holding me ransom
Sweet and sour
I devour
Lying here I count the hours

Waking up
Beside you I'm a loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours I got no control
No control
Powerless
And I don't care it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down my eyes are closed
No control
No control
No control

Powerless
And I don't care it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down my eyes are closed
No control
