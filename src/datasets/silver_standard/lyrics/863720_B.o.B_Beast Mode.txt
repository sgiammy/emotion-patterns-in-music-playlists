I really don't know how long I've been doing this shit
I guess 2010â€²s the first year you gave a shit
I was the underdog, so please excuse me a bit
I need some space so please someone make me some room in this bitch
'Cause I'm in Beast mode, feast mode
Give me those beats I eat those
All day I don't sleep no
I don't even know what I got sheets for
Them pillow cases and bed frames oh nah take that, don't need those
So high I don't get high, don't even know what I got weed for
People I'm in beast mode, why'd you think I got these teeth for
Why do I rep that east side and why do they all call me B.O
But see I do this beat for
Anybody fed my ego
Back in the hood at east shows
So we take hood wherever we go
Please know, I am as loyal as loyalty is when it's gave
Dedicated, determined, dependable
Yes I committed myself to the game
Don't be letting them tell you them lies
We make the industry real when it's fake
So stay meditating so your head is facing into the direction you aim bitch!

Okay then, know what my name is
Excuse my language but I'm fed up with the same shit
They say they love me but it's really 'cause I'm famous see
My momma told me all this back when I was nameless
So fuck y'all, I'm shameless, I'm a beast unleashed I'm raging
I'm living inside of this Matrix, this video game that I'm playing
I ride around and they praise me
I crack a smile and they waving
I guess you could call me David Ruffin I'm circlin' The Temptations
Or maybe I'm angry, maybe I just need a little more patience
Or maybe I'm crazy, maybe I just get a little to anxious
Some-times-I-rhyme-like-I'm-inside-Einsteins-mind
Look at the time fly by, plenty of times I've died
Looking at these jive guys, claiming they lost they mind
She ain't really seen shit nigga till you had the whole world flipped upside down
Right side up
From the DEC so the east side's up
Fired up so you know when I get to the booth I go Ham
'Cause I gotta do what I can
So I'm like Kadoosh, kadoosh, kadoosh, I don't know which side I chant

I'm kinda like a blur with these words, guess I'm always heard with these verbs
Running at a hundred kilometers
Man, pretty soon I'm a leave Earth, Earth
Earthlings, or whatever Human beings, I'm a beast
You're a feast, curly fries, onion rings
This is not a fucking game
Ain't no referee's involved
This is military combat soldiers standing guard round my yard
Entourage, Ham Squad to be exact, smoking ham, smacking back
Take your girl have her back, we don't want her round my team
She's a slut and she's a freak, but you don't know 'cause she's discreet
I swear I see everything that's a bit
Man I'm fed up to my neck with the stress
I could use a wish Hayley where you at
I guess the only exception to these girls is that I rap
But I only attack

'Cause I'm in beast mode, just beast mode
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster, Monster
Energy drinks shoulda been my sponsor
But sometimes I wonder
What is this race I run for?
I don't give a fuck about numbers so I do find it ironic
These niggas get mad at me, talking all sideways with they eyes glazed
They mad 'cause I'm straight
What the mind see's the eyes say
And they say that I went pop and the streets say
I ain't hip hop but if this not let the shit stop
