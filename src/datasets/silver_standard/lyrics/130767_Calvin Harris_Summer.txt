When I met you in the summer
To my heartbeat's sound
We fell in love
As the leaves turned brown

And we could be together, baby
As long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now
But you lied so soon
When I met you in the summer

When I met you in the summer
To my heartbeat's sound
We fell in love
As the leaves turned brown

And we could be together, baby
As long as skies are blue
You act so innocent now
But you lied so soon
When I met you in the summer

When I met you in the summer
Summer
