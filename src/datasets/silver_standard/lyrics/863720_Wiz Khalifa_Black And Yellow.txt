Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Black and yellow, black and yellow, black and yellow, black and yellow
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Black and yellow, black and yellow, black and yellow, black and yellow
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is

Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, I do it big
Yeah, uh huh, screamin' that's nothin'
What I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin'

Reppin' my town when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow, black and yellow, black and yellow, black and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds I'm in
Black and yellow, black and yellow, black and yellow, black and yellow

Black stripe, yellow paint
Them niggas scared of it but them hoes ain't
Soon as I hit the club look at them hoes face
Hit the pedal once make the floor shake

Suede insides, my engine roarin'
It's the big boy you know what I paid for it
And I got the pedal to the metal
Got you niggas checkin' game I'm ballin' out on every level

Hear them haters talk but there's nothing you can tell 'em
Just made a million got another million on my schedule
No love for 'em nigga breakin' hearts
No keys, push to start

Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, I do it big
Yeah, uh huh screamin' that's nothin'
What I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin'

Reppin' my town when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow, black and yellow, black and yellow, black and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds I'm in
Black and yellow, black and yellow, black and yellow, black and yellow

Got a call from my jeweler, this just in
Bitches love me 'cause I'm fuckin' with their best friends
Not a lesbian but she a freak though
This ain't for one night I'm shinin' all week hoe

I'm sippin' Clicquot and rockin' yellow diamonds
So many rocks up in the watch I cant tell what the time is
Got a pocket full of big faces
Throw it up 'cause every nigga that I'm with Taylored

Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, I do it big
Yeah, uh huh screamin' that's nothin'
What I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin'

Reppin' my town when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow, black and yellow, black and yellow, black and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds I'm in
Black and yellow, black and yellow, black and yellow, black and yellow

Stay high like how I'm supposed to do
That crowd underneath them clouds, can't get close to you
And my car look unapproachable
Super clean but its super mean

She wanna fuck with them cats, smoke weed
Count stacks, get fly, take trips and that's that
Real rap, I let her get high as she want and she feel that
Convertible drop fill, 87 the top peel back

Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is

Reppin' my town when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow, black and yellow, black and yellow, black and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds I'm in
Black and yellow, black and yellow, black and yellow, black and yellow

Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, I do it big
Yeah, uh huh screamin' that's nothin'
What I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin'

Reppin' my town when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow, black and yellow, black and yellow, black and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds I'm in
Black and yellow, black and yellow, black and yellow, black and yellow
