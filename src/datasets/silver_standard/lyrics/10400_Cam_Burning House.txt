I had a dream about a burning house
You were stuck inside
I couldn't get you out
I laid beside you and pulled you close
And the two of us went up in smoke

Love isn't all that it seems I did you wrong
I'll stay here with you until this dream is gone

I've been sleepwalking
Been wandering all night
Trying to take what's lost and broken
Make it right
I've been sleepwalking
Too close to the fire
But it's the only place that I can hold you tight
In this burning house

See you at a party and you look the same
I could take you back
But people don't ever change
Wish that we could go back in time
I'd be the one you thought you'd find

I've been sleepwalking
Been wandering all night
Trying to take what's lost and broken
Make it right
I've been sleepwalking
Too close to the fire
But it's the only place that I can hold you tight
In this burning house

The flames are getting bigger now
In this burning house
I can hold on to you somehow
In this burning house
Oh when I don't want to wake up
In this burning house

I've been sleepwalking
Been wandering all night
Trying to take what's lost and broken
Make it right
I've been sleepwalking
Too close to the fire
But it's the only place that I can hold you tight
In this burning house
