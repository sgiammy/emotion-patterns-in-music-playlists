Life can be so vicious that we can't even appreciate its purities 
We get so excited that we can't feel any of our insecurities

All of what you said
It went right above my head
And it's gone

Feels like an attack
When I'm asking for it back, I know

Dream, rebel
Trust, youth
Free, life
Clash, truth
Real, time
Gone, through
Peace, piss
Shine, brute

Clash, truth
Lush, you
Lost, time
So, few
Charge, train
Hate, proof

Nothing real
Nothing true
