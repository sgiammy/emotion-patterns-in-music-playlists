Won't be so easy this time to hurt me
You can try and this time now baby there are no tears left here to cry
If you think you can woo me like before if you think you can do that anymore
Won't get too far no, you can't break a broken heart
So try your best now baby, try your best to break me
You can't break a broken heart

No damage you can do now, I'm immune to you now
You can't break what broke apart
There's nothing you can do to me no more
You can't break a broken heart
Hurt me before now won't hurt no more now not this time
You might do better messing with someone else's mind
'Cause you're not gonna break me down again
You're done and through with me they way you did

It's gone too far
You can't break a broken heart
So try you best now baby, try your best to break me
You can't break a broken heart
No damage you can do now, I'm immune to you now
You can't break what broke apart
There's nothing you can do to me no more
You can't break a broken heart
So don't waste your time
Your time has come and gone
What do you hear boy you can't hurt me anymore

So try your best now baby, try your best to break me
You can't break a broken heart
No damage you can do now, I'm immune to you now
You can't break what broke apart
There's nothing you can do to me no more
You can't break a broken heart

So try your best now baby, try your best to break me
You can't break a broken heart
No damage you can do now, I'm immune to you now
You can't break what you broke apart
There's nothing you can do to me no more
You can't break a broken heart
