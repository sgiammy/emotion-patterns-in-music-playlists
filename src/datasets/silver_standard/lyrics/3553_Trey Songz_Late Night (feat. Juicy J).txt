A lot of fish in the sea, I'm feeling like a great white
Girl, you got a face like oh, oh
Might wanna see you in the daytime, oh, oh
If the money don't sleep, I won't close my eyes for a second
You come first, I come second
'Bout to give you this blessin', finna teach you this lesson
Get you out of that dress and I don't know nothing 'bout affection

Girl, quit playing, Juicy J can't be your man
No discussion, bitch, fiddling, fucking then toss you with the bands
She ratchet, Dirty Diana, doing anything to get on that camera
Straight shot trying to get her Instagram up
On the internet getting niggas jammed up
Know your type the only thing I'm spending with you is the night
Turn you on it and if the face looking right I might hit it twice
Drill the chick after the club and then I sent her back
Might as well work at least the way she give me cab
She throwing that like a quarterback
Call me Warren Sapp, I tackle that
Hit me when I'm in your town, I'm smashing that

Ending up on that tub, but for now we on this club
