Oh no no, yeah
I know the secret we share
Look what this feeling has done to me
There's something deep in the air
Just hope your hands lift me comfortably

I don't know why but every time I see you smiling
I'm tired of running tired of playing tired of hiding
If we could be together would that make you happy?
And If it wouldn't, tell your girlfriend to get at me
(I'm just playing tho)

Love don't really happen
Love don't really happen
Love don't really happen
Love don't really happen

I think there's something for us
Lying around as the world comes down
If you understand what I'm saying
You won't end up in the lost and found, nope

I don't know why but every time I see you dancing
(I see you dancing)
I'm tired of running tired of playing late romancing
(I don't want to)
If we could be together would that make you happy?
(I don't fuck with that)
And If it wouldn't, tell your girlfriend to get at me

Love don't really happen
Love don't really happen
Love don't really happen
Love don't really happen

Now why can't everyday be like this
Smoke a J at the beach like this
Hang with bae at the beach like this
Conversations with Kish like this (hey!)
Never thought it could be like this
Be the man like I am like this
Dance around shake your hips like this
Mess around make a hit like this

Like this, like this, no
Always be like this, no
Like this
Like this
Like this, no
Always be like this, no
Like this
Always be like this
Like this
