Ooh, Devin won't go to heaven
She's just another lost soul
About to be mine again
Leave her, we will receive her
It is beyond your control
Will you ever meet again?

Devin, one of eleven
Who had been rendered
Unwhole as a little child
She was taken and then forsaken
You will remember it all
Let it fill your mind again:

Devin lies beyond this portal
Take the word of one immortal

Give your soul to me for eternity
Release your life to begin another time with her
End your grief with me, there's another way
Release your life, take your place inside the fire with her

Sever now and forever
You're just another lost soul
About to be mine again
See her, you'll never free her
You must surrender it all
If you'd like to meet again

Fire for your desire
As she begins to turn cold for the final time
You will shiver till you deliver
You will remember it all
And it fill your mind again

Devin lies beyond this portal
Take the word of one immortal

Give your soul to me for eternity
Release your life to begin another time with her
End your grief with me, there's another way
Release your life, take your place inside the fire with her

Take me away, yeah

Give your soul to me for eternity
Release your life to begin another time with her
Rid your grief with me, there's another way
Release your life, take your place inside the fire with her

Devin, one of eleven
Who had been rendered
Unwhole as a little child
She was taken and then forsaken
You will remember it all
Let it fill your mind again, man
