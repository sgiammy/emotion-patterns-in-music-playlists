I must accept these consequences for my actions
When all I did was what the world told me I should do
And do anything for my dreams, if only I knew
The cost of my dreams, a.k.a. you, would be you

I'm dead now

The nightmare is slowly taking over
All that's happened, it is enabling him
To take exactly what he wants
Until he gets what he desires, we'll be at his whim

My inner demon, he is screamin' at me, "Take her now
This is your only chance, won't get another, don't let me down
Don't fuckin' whine, the deed is done, you'll be just fine
So you want true romance? Throw the dice, take a chance"

Why won't you let me in? Just let me in
We'll masquerade this awkward phase that we're stuck in
If you accept me and forever be by my side
Remember what I said? "Every day's a new sunrise"
So let's just act pretend like this never happened
I'm your arcane guardian (Just let me in)

You know our love is caught in your eyes
And those hazel eyes
They terrorize, they terrorize

My inner demon, he is screamin' at me, "Take her now
This is your only chance, won't get another, don't let me down
Don't fuckin' whine, the deed is done, you'll be just fine
So you want true romance? Throw the dice, take a chance"

Don't let me down
If I can't have you, I will never be found (Never be found)
It's sure to kill me if you leave me
So I'll leave you gagged and bound (By my side)
I won't reside, never abide (Tell me why)
Won't live my life caught in a lie

Baby don't scream

Don't scream, you are not alone
His arms are not your new home
Now just close your eyes
You will never say goodbye
Baby don't scream
You know I did this all for you and me (Tell me why)
Bitch, don't fucking scream
You know I did this all just for me

You know our love is caught in your eyes
And those hazel eyes
They terrorize, they terrorize

Don't let me down
If I can't have you, I will never be found (Never be found)
It's sure to kill me if you leave me
So I'll leave you gagged and bound (By my side)
I won't reside, never abide (Tell me why)
Won't live my life caught in a lie
