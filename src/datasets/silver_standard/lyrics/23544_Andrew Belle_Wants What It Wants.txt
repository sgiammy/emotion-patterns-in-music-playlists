So, where do I begin this, my love?
Am I blowing down your door way?
If so then I'll rebuild it this time
And I'll be on my way

Come if you believe me
Come if you remember the way
If not then I will find you this time
Wishing you had stayed

Because it
It wants what it wants
The heart does
It wants what it wants
The heart, the heart
It wants what it wants
The heart does
It wants what it wants
The heart, the heart

So, how do I forget this, my love?
And when do I belong here?
If trouble is a pathway we build
Then I'm a pioneer

Blame it on the illness
Blame it on the winter we've had
But suddenly the finger I pointed
Is on the other hand

Pushing the night
Bending the light
I succumb to
I succumb to it
Pushing the night
Bending the light
