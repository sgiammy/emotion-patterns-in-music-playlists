I used to believe
We were burnin' on the edge of somethin' beautiful
Somethin' beautiful
Sellin' a dream
Smoke and mirrors keep us waitin' on a miracle
On a miracle

Say, go through the darkest of days
Heaven's a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh, it's been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down

Don't you give up
I won't give up
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up
I won't give up
Let me love you
Let me love you
Oh baby, baby

Don't fall asleep
At the wheel, we've got a million miles ahead of us
Miles ahead of us
All that we need
Is a rude awakening to know we're good enough
Know we're good enough

Say go through the darkest of days
Heaven's a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh it's been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down

Don't you give up
I won't give up
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up
I won't give up
Let me love you
Let me love you
Oh baby, baby

Don't you give up
I won't give up
Let me love you
Let me love you
Don't you give up
I won't give up
Let me love you
Let me love you
Oh baby, baby
