Oh won't you stay for awhile
I'll take you on a ride
If you can keep our secrets
Oh won't you stay for awhile
Show me goggles baby
Show me deep inside

Oh won't you stay for awhile
I'll take you on a ride
If you can keep our secrets
Oh won't you stay for awhile
Show me goggles baby
Show me deep inside

Oh won't you stay for awhile
I'll take you on a ride
If you can keep our secrets

Stay awhile
Stay awhile and I'll make it worth your while
Worth your while
Stay awhile
Stay awhile and I'll go the extra mile
Extra mile

But if you wait until the lights goes down
I got some drinks that'll help scream right now
So stay awhile
Stay awhile and I'll make it worth your while
Worth your while

Oh won't you stay for awhile

Oh won't you stay for awhile
I'll take you on a ride
If you can keep our secrets

Oh won't you
