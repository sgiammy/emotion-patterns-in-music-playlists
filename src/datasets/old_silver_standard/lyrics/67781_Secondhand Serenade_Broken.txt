In the moonlight, your face it glows
Like a thousand diamonds, I suppose
And your hair flows like the ocean breeze
Not a million fights could make me hate you
You're invincible, yeah its true
It's in your eyes where I find peace

Is it broken? Can we work it out?
Let's light up the town, scream out loud
Is it broken? Can we work it out?
I can see in your eyes, you're ready to break
Don't look away

So here we are now
In a place where the sun blends in with the ocean thin
(With the ocean thin, so thin we stand)
Across from each other, together we'll wonder if we will last these days
If I asked you to stay would you tell me
You would be mine?
(That you think that we are broken)
Think that we are broken...

And time is all I ask for, time, I just need one more day
(Just one more day, just one more day)
And time, you've been crying too long, time
And your tears wrote this song, stay

In the moonlight, your face it glows

Is it broken? Can we work it out?
Let's light up the town, scream out loud
Is it broken? Can we work it out?
(Didn't I tell you that I'd never leave? I need you now, more than I did before)
I can see in your eyes, you're ready to break
Don't look away
