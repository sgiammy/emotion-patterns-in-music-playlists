Were you honest when you said
I could never leave your bed
Wake me up and let me know
You're alive

And will you fall in love again
Is the scent slowly spreading?
I've been answering machines
All night

Now the doctors dancing in
While the ambulances sing
Another boy
Without a sharper knife

The moment that's where
I kill the conversation
Wrap this up with a knife that loves to feel
How do you know how deep to go before it's real

Take me home
Can I even complicate your breathing?
I guess I'm just your average boy
This is me

With a knife in the back
And a grip on the glass, it's cold
And I don't want to be here
I guess I'm never comfortable or situational

Are we losing or beginning
To try a new life without you?

The moment that's where
I kill the conversation
Wrap this up with a lie that I'm enjoying
Every minute with myself

And she could make hell
Feel just like home
So I'm never leaving her alone
But if your lightning lips aren't mine
Then I don't know the awkward stranger to my right

She's crying
I only need one hand to drive
When you're with me
You are my getaway

Oh, no
And don't you ever feel alone?
And don't you wish you were
Cut the lust tonight
Alright, alright, tell me why? My

Little Mona Lisa told a lie, lie, lie, lie

Do you want me?
Do you want to let me know that you're okay
A diamond gold ring
Customized to cut your circulation

But I couldn't let you go
No, I never let you go, my dear
So keep talking
'Cause I love to hear your voice

To your voice
To your voice
To your voice again
