Whenever you're near I hide my tears
Behind a painted smile
You can't imagine the tears and sorrow
Behind a painted smile

My life's a masquerade
A world of let's pretend, dear
Since you took your love
Pretending never ends, dear

But I can't let you know
That I still need you so, no

(Darling I hide the tears that I cry)
Whenever you're near I hide my tears
Behind a painted smile
You can't imagine the tears and sorrow
Behind a painted smile

I can't let you see
All the tears I'm crying
You would pity me --
That would be like dying

If I can't have your love
I don't need your sympathy

(Darling I hide the tears that I cry)
Whenever you're near I hide my tears
Behind a painted smile
You can't imagine the tears and sorrow
Behind a painted smile

My life is a masquerade
Since you took your love away

Whenever you're near I hide my tears
I just can't let you see
How much you hurting me

Whenever you're near I hide my tears
Behind a painted smile
