I eat my dinner in my bathtub, then I go to sex clubs
Watching freaky people getting it on
It doesn't make me nervous, if anything, I'm restless
Yeah, I've been around and I've seen it all
I get home, I got the munchies, binge on all my Twinkies
Throw up in the tub, then I go to sleep
And I drank up all my money, dazed and kinda lonely

You're gone and I gotta stay high
All the time to keep you off my mind, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
High all the time to keep you off my mind, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Spend my days locked in a haze, trying to forget you babe, I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life to forget I'm missing you, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Pick up daddies at the playground, how I spend my daytime
Loosen up the frown, make them feel alive
Make it fast and greasy, I'm numb and way too easy

You're gone and I gotta stay high
All the time to keep you off my mind, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
High all the time to keep you off my mind, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Spend my days locked in a haze, trying to forget you babe, I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life to forget I'm missing you, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Staying in my play pretend where the fun, it got no end, oh
Can't go home alone again, need someone to numb the pain, oh
Staying in my play pretend where the fun, it got no end, oh-oh
Can't go home alone again, need someone to numb the pain

You're gone and I gotta stay high
All the time to keep you off my mind, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
High all the time to keep you off my mind, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Spend my days locked in a haze, trying to forget you babe, I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life to forget I'm missing you, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
