Your skin is warm like an oven, your kiss is sugary sweet
Your fingers feel like cotton when you put your arms around me
I feel like I'm just missing something whenever you leave
We've got all the ingredients except you loving me

And respectfully

I'm not a piece of cake for you to just discard
While you walk away with the frosting of my heart
So I'm taking back what's mine, you'll miss
The slice of heaven that I gave to you last night

You smell just like vanilla, you taste like buttercream
You're filling up my senses with empty calories
I feel like I'm just missing something whenever you leave
We've got all the ingredients except you needing me

So respectfully

I'm not a piece of cake for you to just discard
While you walk away with the frosting of my heart
So I'm taking back what's mine, you'll miss
The slice of heaven that I gave to you last night

If I am just a piece of cake
I am just a piece of cake (cake)
Then you're just a piece of meat
You're just a piece of meat to me

If I am just a piece of cake
I am just a piece of cake (cake)
Then you're just a piece of meat
You're just a piece of meat to me

I'm not a piece of cake for you to just discard
While you walk away with the frosting of my heart
So I'm taking back what's mine, you'll miss
The slice of heaven that I gave to you last night

The slice of heaven that I gave
S-s-slice of heaven that I gave to you
Slice of heaven that I gave to you last night
