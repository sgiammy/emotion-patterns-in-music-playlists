You'd take the clothes off my back and I let you
You'd steal the food right out of my mouth and I watch you eat it
I still don't know why, why I love you so much
Ohhh

You curse my name in spite to put me to shame
Air all my laundry in the streets, dirty or clean
Give it up for fame
But I still don't know why, why I love it so much
Yeah

And baby. it's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold

One day you here, one day you there
One day you care, you're so unfair
Sipping from your cup till it runneth over
Holy Grail

Blue told me to remind you niggas
Fuck that shit y’all talk about, I'm the nigga
Caught up in all these lights and cameras
But look what that shit did to Hammer

God damnit it I like it
The bright lights enticing
But look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night
Thirty mil for one fight
But soon as all the money blows
All the pigeons take flight

Fuck the fame, keep cheating on me
What I do, I took her back
Fool me twice, that's my bad
I can't even blame her for that

Enough to make me wanna murder
Mama please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame
Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself, uh

And we all just entertainers
And we're stupid and contagious
Now we all just entertainers

And baby. it's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold

One day you here, one day you there
One day you care, you're so unfair
Sipping from your cup till it runneth over
Holy Grail

Now I got tattoos on my body
Psycho bitches in my lobby
I got haters in the paper
Photo shoots with paparazzi

Can't even take my daughter for a walk
See 'em by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off
Enough is enough, I'm calling this off

Who the fuck I'm kidding though?
I'm getting high, sitting low
Sliding by in that big body
Curtains all in my window

This fame hurt but this chain works
I think back, you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga deal with it, this shit ain't work

This light work
Camera snapping, my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and IRS

Get the hell up off of your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for, dry yours
Why you mad, take the good with the bad
Don't throw that baby out with the bath water

You're still alive
Still that nigga
Nigga you survived
You still getting bigger nigga
Living the life
Vanilla wafers in a villa
Illest nigga alive
Michael Jackson, Thriller

And baby. it's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold

One day you here, one day you there
One day you care, you're so unfair
Sipping from your cup till it runneth over
Holy Grail

You get the air of my lungs whenever you need it
You take the blade right out of my heart just so you can watch me bleeding
I still don’t know why, why I love you so much
Yeah

And you play this game in spite to drive me insane
I got it tattooed on my sleeve forever in ink with guess who’s name
But I still don't know why, why I love it so much
Yeah

And baby. it's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold

One day you here, one day you there
One day you care, you're so unfair
Sipping from your cup till it runneth over
Holy Grail
