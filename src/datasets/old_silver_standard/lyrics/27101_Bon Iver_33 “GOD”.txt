(When we leave this room, it's gone)
Is the company stalling
We had what we wanted, your eyes

(When we leave this room, it's gone)
With no word from the former
I'd be happy as hell if you stayed for tea

(I know so well that this is all there is)
This is how we grow now, woman
A child ignored
These will just be places to me now
The foreman is down

(When we leave this room, it's gone)
We rise in the stairs

(I find God and religions too)
Staying at the Ace Hotel
If the calm would allow
I would just be floating to you now
It would make me pass to let it pass on
I'm climbing the dash, that skin

(Here in this room, this narrow room)
(Where life began when we were young last night)

Well, we walked up on that bolt in the street
After you tied me in in the driveway of the apartment of his Bede
Sent your sister home in a cab
Said I woulda walked across any thousand lands
No, not really if you can't
I didn't need you that night
Not gonna need you anytime
Was gonna take it as it goes
I could go forward in the light
Well, I better fold my clothes

All my goodness
(I'll be looking through your eyes)
(I'll be looking through your eyes)

All my goodness to show
(Why are you so far from saving me)
(Why are you so far from saving me)
