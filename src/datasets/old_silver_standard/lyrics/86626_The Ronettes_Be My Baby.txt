The night we met I knew I needed you so
And if I had the chance I'd never let you go
So won't you say you love me
I'll make you so proud of me
We'll make 'em turn their heads every place we go

So won't you, please
(Be my, be my baby) Be my little baby
(My one and only baby) Say you'll be my darlin'
(Be my, be my baby) Be my baby now
Wha-oh-oh-oh

I'll make you happy, baby, just wait and see
For every kiss you give me, I'll give you three
Oh, since the day I saw you
I have been waiting for you
You know I will adore you 'til eternity

So won't you, please
(Be my, be my baby) Be my little baby
(My one and only baby) Say you'll be my darlin'
(Be my, be my baby) Be my baby now
Wha-oh-oh-oh-oh

So come on and please
(Be my, be my baby) Be my little baby
(My one and only baby) Say you'll be my darlin'
(Be my, be my baby) Be my baby now
Wha-oh-oh-oh

(Be my, be my baby) Be my little baby
(My one and only baby) Oh
(Be my, be my baby) Oh
Wha-oh-oh-oh-oh

(Be my, be my baby) Oh
(My one and only baby) Oh
(Be my, be my baby) Be my baby now
Wha-oh-oh-oh
