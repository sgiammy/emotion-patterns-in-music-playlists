Tears are falling from your eyes
You've been hurt by all those lies
About me. About me.
They say my love is wrong for you babe
They say it won't be long before
I'll walk out on you
Say the fun is through
Get me someone new
And do you believe
Don't play the fool

Turn your back and walk away.
Listen to your people say
About me About me.
He's never satisfied with you babe
Lord I know he said he'd die for you
But he doesn't mind
If you're left behind
Yeah, we know he's kind
And do you believe
Don't play the fool

I don't understand
Who you think I am
Am I your man
Am I your man

Hearts can see but eyes are blind
No one knows my second mind
No one but me No one but me
You know how you feel babe
Yes, and that is all that's real
And if I say what I feel today
Won't fade away
Then do you believe those little fools
Oh, yes you will
Yes you will now
