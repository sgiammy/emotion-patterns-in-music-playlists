(Baby squirrel, you's a sexy motherfucker)

Give me your, give me your, give me your attention, baby
I gotta tell you a little somethin' about yourself
You're wonderful, flawless, ooh, you a sexy lady
But you walk around here like you wanna be someone else
 
Ooh, whoa
I know that you don't know it, but you're fine, so fine (fine, so fine)
Ooh, whoa
Oh girl, I’m gonna show you when you're mine, oh mine (mine, oh mine)
 
Treasure, that is what you are
Honey, you're my golden star
You know you can make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure, ooh ooh ooh
 
Pretty girl, pretty girl, pretty girl, you should be smiling
A girl like you should never look so blue
You're everything I see in my dreams
I wouldn't say that to you if it wasn't true
 
Ooh, whoa
I know that you don't know it, but you're fine, so fine (fine, so fine)
Ooh, whoa
Oh girl, I’m gonna show you when you're mine, oh mine (mine, oh mine)
 
Treasure, that is what you are
Honey, you're my golden star
You know you can make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure, ooh ooh ooh
 
You are my treasure, you are my treasure
You are my treasure, yeah, you, you, you, you are
You are my treasure, you are my treasure
You are my treasure, yeah, you, you, you, you are
 
Treasure, that is what you are
Honey, you're my golden star
You know you can make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure, ooh ooh ooh
