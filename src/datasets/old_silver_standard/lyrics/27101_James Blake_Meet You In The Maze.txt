Every friend in need
Every memory
It's me who makes the peace in me
All I wanna sleep with, see
It's me that makes the peace in me

From November through 'til now
I hadn't felt, and I am
Weakened, lost and floating loose
I woke you every now and then

From one of those days
I saw those Northern Lights
I wanted you to see them
I wonder if you'll see them
Or if you'll travel long and find another
Or if you'll find another

I'll meet you in the maze
I'll meet you in the maze
I'll meet you in the maze

All those songs that came before you
All those songs that came before you
All those songs that came before you
They were once awaiting
Music can't be everything
Music can't be everything

That's why I see you clear as air
And it's not from my creating
Music can't be everything
All those songs that came before
All those songs that came before you
They were once awaiting
Music can't be everything

I'll meet you in the maze
I'll meet you in the maze
Before you know, you've filled the page
Before you fill the page
They were once awaiting
Music can't be everything
