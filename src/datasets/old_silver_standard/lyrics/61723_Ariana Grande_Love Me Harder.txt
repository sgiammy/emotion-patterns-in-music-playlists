Ariana Grande:
Tell me something I need to know,
Then take my breath and never let it go...
If you just let me invade your space,
I'll take the pleasure, take it with the pain...

And if in the moment, I bite my lip,
Baby, in that moment, you'll know this is
Something bigger than us and beyond bliss;
Give me a reason to believe in...

'Cause if you want to keep me,
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder;
And if you really need me,
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder... (Baby, love me harder...)

(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo...) Love me, love me, love me...
(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo...) Harder, harder, harder...

The Weeknd:
I know your motives, and you know mine;
The ones that love me, I tend to leave behind...
If you know about me, and choose to stay,
Then take this pleasure, and take it with the pain...

And if in the moment, you bite your lip,
When I get you moanin', you know it's real...
Can you feel the pressure between your hips?
I'll make you feel like the first time...

Ariana Grande, [The Weeknd]:
'Cause if you want to keep me,
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder; [I'ma love you harder...]
And if you really need me,
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder... [Baby, love me harder...]

(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo...) Love me, love me, love me...
(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo...) Harder, harder, harder...
(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo...) Love me, love me, love me...
(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo...) Harder, harder, harder... (Gotta love me harder...)

The Weeknd: So what do I do if I can't figure it out?
Ariana Grande: You got to try, try, try again, yeah...
The Weeknd: So what do I do if I can't figure it out?
Ariana Grande: I'm gonna leave, leave, leave again...

Ariana Grande, [The Weeknd]:
'Cause if you want to keep me,
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder;
(I'ma love you, love you, love you...)
And if you really need me,
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder...
(Love me, love me, baby...)
'Cause if you wanna keep me,
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder;
[Gotta, gotta, gotta...] (Love me harder... love me harder...)
And if you really need me,
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, got to love me harder...
[I'ma do it, do it, do it... I'ma love you harder...] (Whoo!)

(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo...) Love me, love me, love me... [Love you...]
(Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo...) Harder, harder, harder...
(Oh, baby, love me, love me, baby,) (Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo...) Love me, love me, love me...
(Just a little bit harder, harder, baby...) (Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo...) Harder, harder, harder...
