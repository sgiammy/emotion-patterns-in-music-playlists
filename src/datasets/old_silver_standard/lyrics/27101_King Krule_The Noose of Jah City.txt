It eats away at the brain
As your strain to try and maintain
Felt the same
I'm always to blame
It took my days out of place
And integrates and negotiate
A loss of faith

Now I'm surrounded
They saw me fall from here but not hit the ground
And I's been dying
The body found and my soul was left to drown
Suffocated in concrete
It took a hold of me
Put me on repeat
Now your last routine
And you start to leave
Towards an escape
But I feel sustained

It eats away at the brain
As your strain to try and maintain
Felt the same
I'm always to blame
It took my days out of place
And integrates and negotiate
A loss of faith

These wounds grow too large
I start to lose the sense of life
The rubicon's a warning
As I see they're washing away my pride
And in the tide
I saw the crimes I passed them by
I wonder why?
I question why?

It eats away at the brain
As your strain to try and maintain
Felt the same
I'm always to blame
It took my days out of place
And integrates and negotiate
A loss of faith
