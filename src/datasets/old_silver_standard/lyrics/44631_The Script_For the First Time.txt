She's all laid up in bed with a broken heart
While I'm drinking Jack all alone in my local bar
And we don't know how
How we got into this mad situation
Only doing things out of frustration

Trying to make it work but man these times are hard
She needs me now but I can't seem to find the time
I've got a new job now in the unemployment line
And we don't know how
How we got into this mess, is it God's test?
Someone help us 'cause we're doing our best

Trying to make it work but man these times are hard
But we're gonna start by drinking old cheap bottles of wine
Shit talkin' up all night
Saying things we haven't for a while, a while yeah
We're smiling but we're close to tears
Even after all these years
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting
For the first time

She's in line at the door with her head held high
While I just lost my job but didn't lose my pride
But we both know how
How we're gonna make it work when it hurts
When you pick yourself up you get kicked to the dirt

Trying to make it work but man these times are hard
But we're gonna start by drinking old cheap bottles of wine
Shit talkin' up all night
Doing things we haven't for a while, a while yeah
We're smiling but we're close to tears
Even after all these years
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting
For the first time

Yeah, drinking old cheap bottles of wine
Shit talkin' up all night
Saying things we haven't for a while
We're smiling but we're close to tears
Even after all these years
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting
For the first time
Yeah, for the first time
Oh, for the first time
Yeah, for the first time, yeah
We just now got the feeling that we're meeting for the first time

Oh, these times are hard
Yeah they're making us crazy
Don't give up on me baby

Oh, these times are hard
Yeah they're making us crazy
Don't give up on me baby

Oh, these times are hard
Yeah they're making us crazy
Don't give up on me baby

Oh, these times are hard
Yeah they're making us crazy
Don't give up on me baby
