I tear my heart open
I sew myself shut
My weakness is that I care too much
And my scars remind me
That the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

I'm drunk and I'm feeling down
And I just wanna be alone
I'm pissed 'cause you came around
Why don't you just go home?
'Cause you channeled all your pain
And I can't help you fix yourself
You're making me insane
All I can say is

I tear my heart open
I sew myself shut
And my weakness is that I care too much
And our scars remind us
That the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

I tried to help you once
Against my own advice
I saw you going down
But you never realized
That you're drowning in the water
So I offered you my hand
Compassion's in my nature
Tonight is our last stand

I tear my heart open
I sew myself shut
And my weakness is that I care too much
And our scars remind us
That the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

I'm drunk and I'm feeling down
And I just wanna be alone
You should have never come around
Why don't you just go home?
'Cause you're drowning in the water
And I tried to grab your hand
I left my heart open
But you didn't understand
But you didn't understand

Go fix yourself!

I can't help you fix yourself
But at least I can say I tried
I'm sorry but I've gotta move on with my own life

I can't help you fix yourself
But at least I can say I tried
I'm sorry but I've gotta move on with my own life

I tear my heart open
I sew myself shut
And my weakness is that I care too much
And our scars remind us
That the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

I tear my heart open
I sew myself shut
And my weakness is that I care too much
And our scars remind us
That the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel.
