Your precious love
Means more to me than
Any love could ever be

For when I wanted you
I was so lonely and so blue
For that's, that's
What love will do

And, darling, I'm so surprised
Oh, when I first realized
That you, you were fooling me

And, darling, they say
That our love won't grow
But I just want to tell them
That they don't know

For as long as
You're in love with me
Our love will grow wider
Deeper than any sea

Of all the things that I want
In this whole wide world
Is just for you to say
You'll be my girl

And, ooh (wanting you)
While I was wanting you, girl
(I'm so lonely and blue)
For that's, that's
What love can do

And every night
(Wanting you)
(I'm so lonely and blue)
That I got to bed
I dream wonderful
Wonderful dreams of you

And, ooh (wanting you)
While I was wanting you...
