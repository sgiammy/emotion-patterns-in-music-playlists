I've been waiting on the sunset
Bills on my mindset
I can get deny they're getting high
Higher than my income
My income's bread crumbs
I've been trying to survive

The glow that the sun gives
Right around sunset
Helps me realize
This is just a journey

Drop your worries
You are gonna turn out fine
Oh, you'll turn out fine
Fine, oh, you'll turn out fine

But you gotta keep your head up, oh
And you can let your hair down, eh
You gotta keep your head up, oh
And you can let your hair down, eh

I know it's hard, know it's hard
To remember sometimes
But you gotta keep your head up, oh
And you can let your hair down, eh

I've got my hands in my pockets
Kickin' these rocks
It's kinda hard to watch this life go by
I'm buyin' in the skeptics

Skeptics mess with the confidence in my eyes
I'm seeing all the angles, starts to get tangled
I start to compromise
My life and the purpose

Is it all worth it?
Am I gonna turn out fine?
Oh, you'll turn out fine
Fine, oh, you'll turn out fine

But you gotta keep your head up, oh
And you can let your hair down, eh
You gotta keep your head up, oh
And you can let your hair down, eh

I know it's hard, know it's hard
To remember sometimes
But you gotta keep your head up, oh
And you can let your hair down, eh

Only rainbows after rain
The sun will always come again
It's a circle circling
Around again, it comes around again

Only rainbows after rain
The sun will always come again
It's a circle circling
Around again, it comes around

But you gotta keep your head up, oh
And you can let your hair down, eh
You gotta keep your head up, oh
And you can let your hair down, eh

I know it's hard, know it's hard
To remember sometimes
But you gotta keep your head up, oh
And you can let your hair down, eh

Keep your head up, oh
And you can let your hair down, eh
Keep your head up, oh
And you can let your hair down, eh
Keep your head up, oh
And you can let your hair down
