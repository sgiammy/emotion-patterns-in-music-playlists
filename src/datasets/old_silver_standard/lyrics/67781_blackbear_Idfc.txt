Tell me pretty lies, look me in the face
Tell me that you love me even if it's fake
'Cause I don't fucking care at all
You been out all night, I don't know where you been
You slurring all your words, not making any sense
But I don't fucking care at all

'Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fucking care
Like they ain't even there
'Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fucking care
'Cause I'm so fucking scared
I'm only a fool for you
And maybe you're too good for me
I'm only a fool for you
But I don't fucking care at all

Tell me pretty lies, look me in the face
Tell me that you love me even if it's fake
'Cause I don't fucking care at all
You've been out all night, I don't know where you been
You slurring all your words, not making any sense
But I don't fucking care at all

'Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fucking care
Like they ain't even there
'Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fucking care
'Cause I'm so fucking scared
I'm only a fool for you
And maybe you're too good for me
I'm only a fool for you
But I don't fucking care at all
