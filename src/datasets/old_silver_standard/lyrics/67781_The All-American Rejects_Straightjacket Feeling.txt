Back me down from backing up
Hold your breath now, it's stacking up
Etched with marks, but I can deal
And you're the problem and you can't feel
Try this on, straightjacket feeling
So maybe I won't be alone
Take back now, my life you're stealing

Yesterday was hell
But today I'm fine without you
Runaway this time without you
And all I ever thought you would be
That face is tearing holes in me again

Trust you is just one defense
Off a list of others, you don't make sense
Beg me time and time again
To take you back now, but you can't win
Take back now, my life you're stealing

Yesterday was hell
But today I'm fine without you
Runaway this time without you
And all I ever thought you would be
That face is tearing holes in me again
But today I'm fine without you
Runaway this time without you
And all the things you put me through
I'm holding on by letting go of you

And when that memory slips away
There will be a better view from here
And only lonesome you remains
And just the thought of you I fear
It falls away

Yesterday was hell
Today I'm fine without you
Runaway this time without you
And all I ever thought you would be
That face is tearing holes in me again
But today I'm fine without you
Runaway this time without you
And all the things you put me through
I'm holding on by letting go of you
