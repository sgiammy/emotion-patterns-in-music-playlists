Something told me it was over
When I saw you and her talking
Something deep down in my soul said, "Cry Girl"
When I saw you and that girl, walking out

I would rather, I would rather go blind boy
Than to see you, walk away from me child, and all
So you see, I love you so much
That I don't want to watch you leave me baby
Most of all, I just don't, I just don't want to be free no

I was just, I was just, I was just sitting here thinking
Of your kisses and your warm embrace, yeah
When the reflection in the glass that I held to my lips now baby
Revealed the tears that was on my face, yeah

And baby, baby, I would rather, I would rather be blind boy
Than to see you walk away, see you walk away from me, yeah
Baby, baby, baby, I'd rather be blind now
