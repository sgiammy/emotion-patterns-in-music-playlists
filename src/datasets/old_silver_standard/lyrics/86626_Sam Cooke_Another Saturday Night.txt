Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I got some money cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way
Dig this

I got in town a month ago
I seen a lotta girls since then
If I could meet 'em, I could get 'em
But as yet I haven’t met 'em
That's why I'm in the shape I'm in

Here another Saturday night that I ain't got nobody
I got some money cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way

Now, another fella told me
He had a sister who looked just fine
Instead of being my deliverance
She had a strange resemblance
To a cat named Frankenstein

Here another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I got some money cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had some chick to talk to
I'm in an awful way, yeah

Here it is another weekend
And I ain’t got nobody
Man, if I was back home, I’d be swinging
Two chicks on my arm, aw yeah
Listen to me, huh

It's hard on a fella
When he don't know his way around
If I don't find me a honey
To help me spend my money
I'm gonna have to blow this town

Here it's another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I got some money cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had some chick to talk to
I'm in an awful, everybody singin’

Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I got some money cause I just got paid
Now how I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful, one more time

Another Saturday night
