The silence keeps it easy
Keeps you safe for the moment.
As you're walking away
Your foot steps get louder.
All you needed was time
But now time will destroy us.

It will all be over, and here we are
We're stuck inside this salted earth together.
You'll pierce my lungs
My limbs go numb
As my colors fade out.

You watch me bleed.
You watch me bleed.

I gave you everything to die with a smile
All you wanted was to live for a while
You took everything but it left you empty
You can't replace me, you can't.

It's almost over, and here we are
We're stuck inside this salted earth together.
You'll pierce my lungs
My limbs go numb
As my colors fade out.

You watch me bleed.
You watch me bleed.

It will all be over, and here we are
We'll die inside this salted earth together.
You'll pierce my lungs
My limbs go numb
As my colors fade out.

You watch me bleed.
You watch me bleed.
You watch me bleed.
You watch me bleed.

Watch me bleed.
