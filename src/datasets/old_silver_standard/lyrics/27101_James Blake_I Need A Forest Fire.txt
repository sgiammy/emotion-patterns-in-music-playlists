(Another shade, another shadow)
(Another shade, another shadow)
(Another shade, another shadow)
(Another shade, another shadow)

To burn it like cedar
I request another dream
I need a forest fire

(Another shade, another shadow)
(Another shade, another shadow)
(Another shade, another shadow)
(Another shade, another shadow)
(Another shade, another shadow)
(Another shade, another shadow)

To burn it like cedar
I request another dream
I need a forest fire

(Another shade, another shadow)

I'm saved by nature
But it always forgets what I need
I hope you'll stop me before I build a wall around me
We need a forest fire
We need a forest fire
We need a forest fire
We need a forest fire

You're thicker than you think
You know that money bought your name
Caution swelling, can I repay you with some blame

To burn it like cedar
I request another dream
I need a forest fire

To burn it like cedar
I request another dream
I need a forest fire

To burn it like cedar
I request another dream
I need a forest fire

Stop

Stop before I build a wall around me
Stop before I build a wall around me
Stop before I build a wall around me
