Mayday, mayday, this ship is slowly sinking
They think I'm crazy but they don't know the feeling
They're all around me, circling like vultures
They wanna break me and wash away my colors
Wash away my colors

Take me high and I'll sing, oh
You make everything okay, okay, okay ('Kay, okay, okay)
We are one and the same, oh
You take all of the pain away, away, away ('Way, away, away)
Save me if I become my demons

I cannot stop this sickness taking over
It takes control and drags me into nowhere
I need your help, I can't fight this forever
I know you're watching; I can feel you out there

Take me high and I'll sing, oh
You make everything okay, okay, okay ('Kay, okay, okay)
We are one and the same, oh
You take all of the pain away, away, away ('Way, away, away)
Save me if I become my demons

Take me over the walls below
Fly forever, don't let me go 
I need a savior to heal my pain
When I become my worst enemy, the enemy

Take me high and I'll sing
You make everything okay
We are one and the same
You take all of the pain away

Take me high and I'll sing, oh
You make everything okay, okay, okay ('Kay, okay, okay)
We are one and the same, oh
You take all of the pain away, away, away ('Way, away, away)
Save me if I become my demons

Take me high and I'll sing, oh (My demons)
You make everything okay, okay, okay ('Kay, okay, okay)
(My demons) We are one and the same, oh (My demons)
You take all of the pain away, away, away ('Way, away, away)
(My demons) Save me if I become my demons
