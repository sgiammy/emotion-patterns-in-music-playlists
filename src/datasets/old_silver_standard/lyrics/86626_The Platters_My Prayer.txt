When the twilight is gone
And no songbirds are singing
When the twilight is gone
You come into my heart
And here in my heart you will stay while I pray

My prayer
Is to linger with you
At the end of the day
In a dream that's divine

My prayer
Is a rapture in blue
With the world far away
And your lips close to mine

Tonight
While our hearts are aglow
Oh tell me the words
That I'm longing to know

My prayer
And the answer you give
May they still be the same
For as long as we live

That you'll always be there
At the end of my prayer
