I look and stare so deep in your eyes,
I touch on you more and more every time,
When you leave I'm begging you not to go,
Call your name two or three times in a row,
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain,
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame yeah.
'Cause I know I don't understand,
Just how your love can do what no one else can.

Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now,
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss
Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love's,
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love.

When I talk to my friends so quietly,
Who he think he is? Look at what you've done to me,
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress,
You ain't here, ain't nobody else to impress,
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew,
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you,
But I still don't understand,
Just how your love can do what no one else can.

Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now,
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now
Got me hoping you'll save me right now, your kiss
Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love's,
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love.

Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch
Got me looking so crazy right now
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss
Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy in love's,
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love.
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no.
