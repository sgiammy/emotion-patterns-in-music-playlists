If you're sleeping are you dreaming
If you're dreaming are you dreaming of me?
I can't believe you actually picked me

Mother:
Hi, Justin, this is your mother.
It's 2:33 on Monday afternoon.
I was just calling to see how you were doing, you sounded really uptight last night, it made me a little nervous, and well it made me nervous that it sounded like you were nervous, too.
I just want to make sure you are really okay and wanted to see if you were checking in on your medication too.
You know I love ya!
Take care, honey, I know you're under a lot of pressure.
See ya.
Bye, bye!

I have to block out thoughts of you, so I don't lose my head
They crawl in like a cockroach, leaving babies in my bed
Dropping little reels of tape, to remind me that I'm alone
Playing movies in my head, that make a porno feel like home
There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain
An ounce of peace is all I want for you, will you never call again?
And will you never say that you love me, just to put it in my face
And will you never try to reach me, it is I that wanted space

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you

I'm sober now for three whole months, it's one accomplishment that you helped me with
The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing that I won't touch again
In my sick way I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night
While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight
You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicidal hate
You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take
So I'll drive so fucking far away that I never cross your mind
And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you

And with a sad heart I say bye to you and wave
Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I have made
And like a baby boy, I never was a man
Until I saw your blue eyes cry, and I held your face in my hand
And then I fell down yelling, "Make it go away"
Just make her smile come back and shine, just like it used to be
And then she whispered, "How can you do this to me?"

Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you

For you
For you
For you

If you're sleeping are you dreaming
If you're dreaming are you dreaming of me?
I can't believe you actually picked me

Hey, Justin! [12x]
