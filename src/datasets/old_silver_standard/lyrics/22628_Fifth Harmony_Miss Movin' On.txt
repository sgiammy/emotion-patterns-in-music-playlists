Camila:
I'm breakin' down, gonna start from scratch
Shake it off like an etch-a-sketch
My lips are saying goodbye
My eyes are finally dry

Lauren:
I'm not the way that I used to be
I took the record off repeat
It killed me but I survived
And now I'm coming alive

Camila:
I'll never be that girl again
No oh oh
I'll never be that girl again
No oh oh

Lauren:
My innocence is wearing thin
But my heart is growing strong
So call me, call me, call me

All:
Miss movin' on
Oh oh oh
Miss movin' on
Oh oh oh

Normani:
Yeah!

Lauren:
I broke the glass that surrounded me
(Normani: Surrounded me)
I ain't the way you remember me
(Normani: Remember me)
I was such a good girl
So fragile but no more

Dinah:
I jumped the fence to the other side
(Normani: The other side)
My whole world was electrified
(Normani: Electrified)
Now I'm no longer afraid
It's Independence Day

Normani:
It's Independence Day

Camila:
I'll never be that girl again
No oh oh
I'll never be that girl again
No oh oh

Lauren:
My innocence is wearing thin
But my heart is growing strong
So call me, call me, call me

All:
Miss movin' on

Dinah:
Everything is changing and I never wanna go back
To the way it was (Normani: To the way it was)
I'm finding who I am and who I am from here and now
Is gonna be enough (Normani: Is gonna be enough)
Is gonna be enough

Normani:
I'll never be that girl again
No oh oh

Ally:
I'll never be that girl again
Oh oh oh

Lauren:
My innocence is wearing thin
But my heart is growing strong
So call me, call me, call me

All:
Miss movin' on (Dinah: No!)
Oh oh oh
Miss movin' on (Ally: On and on and on and on and on!)
Oh oh oh
Miss movin' on (Camila: On and on and on and on! On and on and on!)
Oh oh oh
Miss movin' on (Normani: Hey yeah yeah!)
Oh oh oh

Lauren:
Yeah, I'm movin' on
