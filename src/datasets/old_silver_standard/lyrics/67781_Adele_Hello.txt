Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years
You'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who
We used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt
Before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call
You never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart
Anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk
About myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side
(Other side)
I must have called a thousand times
(Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call
You never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
(Outside)
At least I can say that I've tried
(I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter
It clearly doesn't tear you apart
Anymore

Ooh, anymore
Ooh, anymore
Ooh, anymore
Anymore

Hello from the other side
(Other side)
I must have called a thousand times

To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call
You never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
(Outside)
At least I can say that I've tried
