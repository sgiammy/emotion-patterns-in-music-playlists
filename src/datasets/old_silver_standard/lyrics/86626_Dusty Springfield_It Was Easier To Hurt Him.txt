I should have told him
That I needed him
When I had the chance
And now he's left me
And it's all over
Goodbye romance
I should have told him then
Over and over again
That I love him

But, it was easier to hurt him, ooh
It was easier to hurt him, ooh
It was easier to hurt him
That's what I thought
Was being so smart

The way I cheated him
And mistreated him
How could I forget?
I was so sure that he
Would always trust in me
Oh, that I'd take a bet, no, no, no
He'd never say goodbye
But here all alone am I
He is gone now, ah, 'cause

It was easier to hurt him
What could I do?
(It was) Easier to hurt him
I should have known better
That's what I thought
Was being so smart, oh, oh
It was easier to hurt him
I need him so bad
(It was) Easier to hurt him
What did I do?
(It was) Easier to hurt him
I should have known better
(It was) Easier to hurt him
I need him so bad
