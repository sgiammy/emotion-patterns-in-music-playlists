And all the smiles that are ever gonna haunt me

You are never coming home
Never coming home
Never coming home
Never coming home

And all the things that you never ever told me
And all the smiles that are ever gonna haunt me

Should I?

And all the wounds that are ever gonna scar me
For all the ghosts that are never gonnaâ€¦
