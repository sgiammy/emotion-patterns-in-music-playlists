(Shhh! Do you wanna hear a secret? I know one)

In this place
There's a bone in thigh
Felt a change
Where the links bent right
Find a name
In the placeless age
Girls and pain
And your window pane
Isolate
From a hundred friends
Wave them on
As the childhood ends
Turn it fast
As one mild day steals
Turn one's soul
Into 20 years
In spirit they've vanished
And they'll show you why
I'll make 'em pay elder
Lift my spite in time
If we were just dolphins
In the sea air fly
It's hard to just kiss our
Child games goodbye

It's hard to just kiss our
Child games goodbye.

(...You just messed the whole thing up!)
