White lips, pale face, breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end, struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight

And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat, tried to swim, stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes, weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple grams
But she don't want to go outside tonight

And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Sells love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly

An angel will die, covered in white
Closed eye and hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

And they say she's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream, been this way since 18
But lately her face seems slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries, they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

And we're all under the upper hand
Go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight

In a pipe, fly to the motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside for angels to fly
Angels to fly

To fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
Angels to die
