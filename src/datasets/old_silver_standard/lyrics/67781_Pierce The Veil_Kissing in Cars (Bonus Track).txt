As we wake up in your room
Your face is the first thing I see
The first time I've seen love
And the last I'll ever need
You remind her that your future
Will be nothing without her
Never lose her, I'm afraid
Better think of something good to say
But it's all been done more than once
I'll keep on trying
Oh god don't let me be the only one who says

No, at the top of our lungs there's no
No, such thing as too young
Second chances won't leave you alone
Then there's faith in love

She was always the one
I'll repeat it again, the one
No such thing as too young
Red lights flashing on the car we're kissing in
Call me crazy, I've always tried to remind her
That the future's just a few heartbeats away from disaster
I'm afraid that I've thrown it all away

No, at the top of our lungs, there's no
No such thing as too young
Second chances won't leave you alone

No at the top of our lungs, there's no
No such thing as too young
Second chances won't leave you alone

No, we'll repeat it again, there's no
No such thing as too young
Second chances won't leave you alone
Cause there's faith in love

If you kiss me goodnight
I'll know everything' is all right
Second chances won't leave us alone
Won't leave us alone
Cause there's faith in love
