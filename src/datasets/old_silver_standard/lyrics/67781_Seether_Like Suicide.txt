Pre-meditation will kill the trust
They'll never know if you fear me 
With every second collecting dust
I feel so bloated and weary

'Cause she belongs to heaven

She's coming over like a suicide
And it's the same old trip, the same old trip as before
Another complicating suicide
And it's the same old trip, the same old trip as before

She'll cut you down with a single thrust
She's taken over too quickly
No medication can kill the lust
So say a prayer for the sickly

'Cause she belongs to heaven 

She's coming over like a suicide
And it's the same old trip, the same old trip as before
Another complicating suicide
And it's the same old trip, the same old trip as before

You set me up to fucking fail this time

She's coming over like a suicide
And it's the same old trip, the same old trip as before
Another overbearing suicide
And it's the same old trip, the same old trip

She's coming over wearing genocide
And it's the same old trip, the same old trip as before
Another complicating suicide 
And it's the same old trip, the same old trip as before
