My friends don't walk, they run
Skinny dip in rabbit holes for fun
Popping, popping balloons with guns
Getting high off helium

We paint white roses red
Each shade from a different person's head
This dream, dream is a killer
Getting drunk with the blue caterpillar

Now I'm peeling the skin off my face
'Cause I really hate being safe
The normals, they make me afraid
The crazies, they make me feel sane

I'm nuts, baby, I'm mad
The craziest friend that you've ever had
You think I'm psycho, you think I'm gone
Tell the psychiatrist something is wrong
Oh, off the bend, entirely bonkers
You like me best when I'm off my rocker
I tell you a secret, I'm not alarmed
So what if I'm crazy? The best people are

All the best people are crazy
All the best people are

Where is my prescription?
Doctor, doctor, please listen
My brain is scattered
You can be Alice, I'll be the mad hatter

I'm peeling the skin off my face
'Cause I really hate being safe
The normals, they make me afraid
The crazies, they make me feel sane

I'm nuts, baby, I'm mad
The craziest friend that you've ever had
You think I'm psycho, you think I'm gone
Tell the psychiatrist something is wrong
Oh, off the bend, entirely bonkers
You like me best when I'm off my rocker
I tell you a secret, I'm not alarmed
So what if I'm crazy? The best people are

You think I'm crazy, you think I'm gone
So what if I'm crazy? All the best people are
And I think you're crazy too, I know you're gone
It's probably the reason that we get along

I'm nuts, baby, I'm mad
The craziest friend that you've ever had
You think I'm psycho, you think I'm gone
Tell the psychiatrist something is wrong
Oh, off the bend, entirely bonkers
You like me best when I'm off my rocker
I tell you a secret, I'm not alarmed
So what if I'm crazy? The best people are

All the best people are crazy
All the best people are
All the best people are crazy
All the best people are
