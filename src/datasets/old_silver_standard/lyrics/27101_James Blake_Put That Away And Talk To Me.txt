You read them all out loud
Best foot forward, 'cause you're a man
As lonely as you feel right now
Where is my beautiful life?
I'm not livin' here, I'm not livin' here anymore
I don't live here anymore
I don't live here anymore

Put that away and talk to me
I'm not the only one with a fantasy
As lonely as you feel right now
Put that away and talk to me

Could you tell me about the early days?
Could you tell me about the early days?

I'm in a waiting after every inhalation
They're keeping me full today
Where is my beautiful life?
I'm not livin' here, I'm not livin' here anymore
I won't know pain anymore
I won't know haze anymore

Put that away and talk to me
I'm not the only one with a fantasy
As lonely as you feel right now
Put that away and talk to me

You know you are just fuel
Afraid to die and nothing to do
Do you like it when your heroes lose?
Where is your beautiful life?
I'm not livin' here, I'm not livin' here anymore
I won't know pain anymore
I won't know haze anymore

Put that away and talk to me
I'm not the only one with a fantasy
Put that away and talk to me
Put that away and talk to me
Put that away and talk to me
Put that away and talk to me

Could you tell me about the early days?
Could you tell me about the early days
