Every night I hope and pray a dream lover who will come my way
A girl to hold in my arms and know the magic of her charms

Because I want, yea a girl to call, yea my own
I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone

Dream lover where are you with the love, oh so true
And the hand that I can hold to feel you near as I grow old

Because I want, yea a girl to call my own
I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone

Yea, some day I don't know how I hope she'll hear my plea
Some way I don't know how she'll bring her love to me

Dream lover until then I'll go to sleep and I dream again
That's the only thing to do till all my lovers dreams come true

Because I want, yea a girl to call, yea my own
I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone

Dream lover until then I'll go to sleep and I dream again
That's the only thing to do till all my lovers dreams come true

Because I want, yea a girl to call my own
I want a dream lover so I don't have to dream alone

Please don't make me dream alone
Baby don't make me dream alone
No, I don't wanna dream alone
