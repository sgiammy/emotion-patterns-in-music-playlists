Oh! Carol
I am but a fool
Darling, I love you
Though you treat me cruel
You hurt me
And you make me cry
But if you leave me
I will surely die

Darling, there will never be another
'Cause I love you so
Don't ever leave me
Say you'll never go

I will always want you for my sweet heart
No matter what you do
Oh! Carol
I'm so in love with you

Oh! Carol
I am but a fool
Darling, I love you
Though you treat me cruel
You hurt me
And you make me cry
But if you leave me
I will surely die

Darling, there will never be another
'Cause I love you so
Don't ever leave me
Say you'll never go

I will always want you for my sweet heart
No matter what you do
Oh! Carol
I'm so in love with you
