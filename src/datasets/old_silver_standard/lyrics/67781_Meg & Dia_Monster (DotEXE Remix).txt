His little whispers
"Love me, love me"
That's all I ask for
"Love me, love me"

He battered his tiny fists to feel something
Wondered what it's like to touch and feel something

Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here
Looking through the windows

That night he caged her
Bruised and broke her
He struggled closer
Then he stole her

Violet wrists and then her ankles, silent pain
Then he slowly saw their nightmares were his dreams

Monster, how should I feel?
Creatures lie here
Looking through the windows
I will hear their voices
I'm a glass child
I am Hannah's regrets

Monster, how should I feel?
Turn the sheets down
Murder ears with pillow lace
There's bath tubs full of glow flies
Bathed in kerosene
Their words tattooed in his veins
