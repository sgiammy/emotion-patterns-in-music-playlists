Nobody sees
Nobody knows
We are a secret can't be exposed
That's how it is 
That's how it goes
Far from the others
Close to each other
That's when we uncover

In the daylight in the daylight
When the sun is shining

On a late night, on a late night
When the moon is blinding

In plain sight 
Plain sight
Like stars in hiding

You and I burn on

Put 2 and 2 gether 4ever
We'll never change
2 and 2 gether
We'll never change

Nobody sees 
Nobody knows
We are a secret can't be exposed
That's how it is That's how it goes
Far from the others
Close to each other
That's when we uncover

My asylum - My asylum
Is in your arms
When the worlds gives heavy burdens
I can bare a thousand tons
On your shoulder - on your shoulder
I can reach an endless sky
Feels like paradise

Put 2 and 2 gether 4ever
We'll never change
2 and 2 gether
We'll never change

Nobody sees 
Nobody knows
We are a secret can't be exposed
That's how it is That's how it goes
Far from the others
Close to each other
That's when we uncover

We could build a universe right here
All the world could disappear
Wouldn't notice, wouldn't care

We could build a universe right here
The world could disappear
Yeah I just need you near

Nobody sees Nobody knows
We are a secret can't be exposed
That's how it is That's how it goes
Far from the others
Close to each other
That's when we uncover
