I know your insides are feeling so hollow
And it's a hard pill for you to swallow
But if I fall for you, I'll never recover
If I fall for you, I'll never be the same

I really want to love somebody
I really want to dance the night away
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way

I really want to touch somebody
I think about you every single day
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way

You're such a hard act for me to follow
Love me today; don't leave me tomorrow, yeah
But if I fall for you, I'll never recover
If I fall for you, I'll never be the same

I really want to love somebody
I really want to dance the night away
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way

I really want to touch somebody
I think about you every single day
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way
Oh
Oh

I don't know where to start, I'm just a little lost
I wanna feel like we never gonna ever stop
I don't know what to do, I'm right in front of you
Asking you to stay, you should stay, stay with me tonight, yeah

I really want to love somebody
I really want to dance the night away
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way

I really want to touch somebody
I think about you every single day
I know we're only half way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way
Oh
Oh

You take me all the way, you take me all the way, yeah
