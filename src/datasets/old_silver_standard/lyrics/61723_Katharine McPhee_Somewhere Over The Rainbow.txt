When all the clouds darken up the skyway
There's a rainbow highway to be found
Leading from your window pain
To a place behind the sun
Just a step behind the rain

Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow
Where birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then oh why can't I

If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow
Why, oh, why can't I
