I'm sick and then I'm well
So full, so empty still
You leave me wanting
Oh tell me where'd you go
Don't be invisible
'Cause I am reaching

Save me
Go on break the glass
Take me
I'm never going back
No

Oh oh oh...
Oh oh oh...

Here on the other side
Oh there's no place to hide
My heart is racing
Hold me, take me in
Without you I can't live
Gravity's pulling

Save me
It's our only chance
Take me
There's no going back

Oh oh oh...
Oh oh oh...

I cannot see you
But I can feel you
I just wanna be with you
I've nowhere else to go
I've nowhere else to go

Oh oh oh...
(Believe me)
Oh oh oh...

Oh oh oh...
(Believe me)
Oh oh oh...
