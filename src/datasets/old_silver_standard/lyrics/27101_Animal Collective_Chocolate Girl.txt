In cycle,
I'll lead you around the ocean,
Where grass grows,
And remnants of you in devotion,
My breath's out,
Inhaling upon trees, it's frozen,
And look out,
And trace along the house where shit is frozen,
Then holding,
Quietly,
The sound is dead,
And sing in turn,
In light.
When life meets child, your only plight
In light.
When ceilings smile, we'll sleep a while
In light.
I'll take you for walks among the patients,

She had a pretty dad,
But she was growing out of play-school,
Still she could kick and scream and play,
Until she wanted to.
My little chocolate girl.
Her brother barely out of high school,
Lived in a place where he could scream,
Until he wanted to.
Oh fuzzy tidy cat.
And she could bury him in apples
And curl around a bowl of cotton
Till she wanted to.

Still she had to speak loud,
'Cause hearing isn't, "I am here with them",
And we took,
A picture: Sunday flowers in the garden.
And quite late,
Still drinking with the boys until it's later.
And pray small,
Your hopes of something better to show her,
And holding tight,
The sound is dead,
It's singing time
In light.
When life meets child, your only plight
In light.
When ceilings smile, we'll sleep a while
In light.
I'll take you for walks among the patients,

She met a pretty boy.
And they would dance between their elders
And she would cream until the wine she bought had settled in.
My little chocolate girl.
She used to love the stars of England.
She slept on records and her market jewelry
From her school,
Her colors matched the room.
And she would twirl around the curtains,
She had a hand to hold her chin up
When her friends walked out,
The kid across the street.
He'll keep around when she was changing,
And he would wait and she would tell her friends about the boy.
Her Mom and Dad at home.
She had saliva in her pockets,
She gave a girl when her last grace hath found thee, dig the day

So good, my chocolate girl,
Oh won't you like an 'A'

So put your lanterns on across the maze,
So I won't feast on folly,
Bell of the rain who brought the stings and dead
And who will pop the trade,
'Cause I can't see you.
I'll open up my brain again.
