There you were, beautiful
The promise of love was written on your face
You led me on with untrue kisses
Oh you held me captive in your false embrace

Quicker than I could bat an eye
Seems you were telling me goodbye
Oh-oh just a minute ago your love was here
All of a sudden it seemed to disappear
Sweetness was only heartache's camouflage
The love I saw in you was just a mirage

We used to meet in romantic places
Oh you gave the illusion that your love was real
Now all that's left are lipstick traces
From the kisses you only pretended to feel

And now our meetings you avoid
And so my world you have destroyed
Oh-oh just a minute ago your love was here
Oh baby all of a sudden it seemed to disappear
Yeah the way you wrecked my life was like sabotage
The love I saw in you was just a mirage

Oh yeah you only filled me with despair
By showing love that wasn't there
Oh just like the desert shows a thirsty man
A green oasis where there's only sand
You lured me into something I should have dodged
Oh the love I saw in you was just a mirage

Whooh yeah
Just like the desert shows a thirsty man
A green oasis where there's only sand
Ooh ooh ooh you lured me into something I should have dodged
