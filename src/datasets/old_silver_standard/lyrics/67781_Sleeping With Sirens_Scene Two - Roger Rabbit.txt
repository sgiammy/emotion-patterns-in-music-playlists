Is there a right way for how this goes
You've got your friends
And you've got your foes
They want a piece of something hot
Forget you're name like they forgot.

Hmmmm

Ain't that something.

Some wanna see you crash and burn
Criticize your every word
I'm trying to keep from going insane
Ain't that the way of this whole damn thing.
Un

Trying to be something... more.

Nobody's gonna love you if
You can't display a way to capture this.

Nobody's gonna hold your hand
And guide you through
No it's up for you to understand.

Nobody's gonna feel your pain
When all is done
And it's time for you to walk away.

So when you have today
You should say all that you have to say.
Hunn
Say all that you have to say.
Hun
Is there a right way for being strong
Feels like I'm doing things all wrong
Still I'm here just holding on
Confess my heart and forgive my wrongs.

Just trying to show you something... more.

Nobody's gonna love you if
You can't display a way to capture this.

Nobody's gonna hold your hand
And guide you through
It's up for you to understand.

Nobody's gonna feel your pain
When all is done
And it's time for you to walk away.

When you have today
You should say all that you have to say.

Don't point the blame when you can't find nothing
Look to yourself and you might find something
It's time that we sorted out
All of the things
We complain about.

So listen close to the sound of your soul
Take back a life
We led once before
If it ain't you then who
If it ain't you
Then who's gonna love you.

Nobody's gonna love you if
You can't display a way to capture this.

Nobody's gonna hold your hand
And guide you through
It's up for you to understand.

Nobody's gonna feel your pain
When all is done
And it's time for you to walk away.

When you have today
You should say all that you have to say.

So when you have today
Say all that you have to say.
