Glory
It's a sweet world
Always
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Always
It's a sweet world
It's so easy
And I'm not afraid
And I have no hurt
Always
She just walks the land
Grounds to an old war
And I'm acting like I'm never sure that it's...

It's a sweet world
May I have her hand?
I won't protect myself
If I find her clothes, I'll keep her
Always

We're nothing left and uneven
We're nothing left and uneven
We're nothing left and uneven

We're nothing left and uneven
We're nothing left and uneven
This is how I wanna feel
It's so easy
Not disappearing
I'm no guardian
But if we're here again
I'll be on your side
I'll lose the (?)

A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Always

It's a sweet world
But who's housing it?
I can unstick these things
And I'll be glad to see them leave forever
Always
And I'll just walk the land
Grounds to an old war
And I'll be acting so sure
It's a sweet world

This is how I wanna feel
Always

It's a sweet world

A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Always
