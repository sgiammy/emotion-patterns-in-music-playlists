Rick James:

Kanye West:
And I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time, for us, to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags, let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags, every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs, that'll never take work off
Baby I got a plan, run away fast as you can

She find pictures in my email
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good at that shit
See I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

And I always find, yeah I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time, for us, to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags, let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags, every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs, that'll never take work off
Baby I got a plan, run away fast as you can

Kanye West and Rick James:
Run away from me baby, run away
Run away from me baby, run away (Look at ya)
Man I'm 'bout to get crazy, just run away
This is my plan, run away as fast as you can

Run away from me baby, run away
Run away from me baby, run away (Look at ya)
Man I'm 'bout to get crazy, why can't she just, run away? (Look at ya)
Baby I got a plan, run away as fast as you can

Pusha T:
24/7, 365, pussy stays on my mind
I, I, I, I did it, all right, alright, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live with it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfucking top off
Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs, haha
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the balla-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless, P

Kanye West:
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
'Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you are at an advantage
'Cause you can blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'mma manage
If one day you just up and leave

And I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time, for us, to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags, let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags, every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs, that'll never take work off
Baby I got a plan, run away fast as you can

Cue the pianos

And I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

And I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most

And I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

And I always find, yeah I always find, yeah I always find somethin' wrong
