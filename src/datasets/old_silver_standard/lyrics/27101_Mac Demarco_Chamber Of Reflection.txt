Spend some time away
Getting ready for the day
You're born again
Spend some time alone
Understand that soon you'll run
With better men

Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone

No use looking out
It's within that brings that
Lonely feeling
Understand that when you leave here
You'll be cleared
Among the better men

Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone

Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone
