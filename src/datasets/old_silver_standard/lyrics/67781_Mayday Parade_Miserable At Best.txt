Katie, don't cry
I know you're trying your hardest
And the hardest part is letting go
Of the nights we share
Ocala is calling
And you know it's haunting
But compared to your eyes
Nothing shines quite as bright
And when we look to the sky
It's not mine, but I want it

So let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
I know he's there
And you're probably hanging out and making eyes
While across the room he stares
I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
And ask my girl to dance
She'll say yes, because these words were never easier
For me to say or her to second guess
But I guess that I can live without you
But without you I'll be miserable at best

You're all that I hoped to find in every single way
And everything I will give is everything you couldn't take
Cause nothing feels like home
You're a thousand miles away
And the hardest part of living is just taking breaths to stay
'Cause I know I'm good for something
I just haven't found it yet and I need it

So let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
I know he's there
And you're probably hanging out and making eyes
While across the room he stares
I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
And ask my girl to dance
She'll say yes, because these words were never easier
For me to say or her to second guess
But I guess that I can live without you
But without you I'll be miserable at best

And this'll be the first time in a week that I'll talk to you
And I can't speak
Been three whole days since I've had sleep
'Cause I dream of his lips on your cheek
And I got the point that I should leave you alone
But we both know that I'm not that strong
And I miss the lips that made me fly

So let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
I know he's there
And you're probably hanging out and making eyes
While across the room he stares
I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
And ask my girl to dance
She'll say yes, because these words were never easier
For me to say or her to second guess
But I guess that I can live without you
But without you I'll be miserable
And I can live without you
But without you I'll be miserable
And I can live without you
Oh, without you I'll be miserable at best
