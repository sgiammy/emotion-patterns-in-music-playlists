Oh well, in five years time we could be walking 'round a zoo
With the sun shining down over me and you
And there'll be love in the bodies of the elephants too
And I'll put my hands over your eyes, but you'll peep through

And there'll be sun sun sun all over our bodies
And sun sun sun all down our necks
And there'll be sun sun sun all over our faces
And sun sun sun -so what the heck

'Cause I'll be laughing at all your silly little jokes
And we'll be laughing about how we used to smoke
All those stupid little cigarettes and drink stupid wine
'Cause it's what we needed to have a good time

But it was fun fun fun when we were drinking
It was fun fun fun when we were drunk
And it was fun fun fun when we were laughing
It was fun fun fun, oh it was fun

Oh well, I look at you and say
It's the happiest that I've ever been
And I'll say I no longer feel I have to be James Dean
And she'll say, "Yeah, well I feel all pretty happy too."
And I'm always pretty happy when I'm just kicking back with you

And it'll be love love love all through our bodies
And love love love all through our minds
And it be Love love love all over her face
And love love love all over mine

Although maybe all these moments are just in my head
I'll be thinking 'bout them as I'm lying in bed
And although not really, it might not even come true
But in my mind I'm havin' a pretty good time with you

In five years time, I might not know you
In five years time, we might not speak at all
In five years time, we might not get along
In five years time, you might just prove me wrong

Oh, there'll be love love love wherever you go
There'll be love love love wherever you go
There'll be love love love wherever you go
There'll be love love love wherever you go

There'll be love love love wherever you go
There'll be love love love wherever you go
There'll be love love love wherever you go
There'll be love love love wherever you go
There'll be love
