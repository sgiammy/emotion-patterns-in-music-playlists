Frankie Lane, he was singing Jezebel
I pinned an Iron Cross to my lapel
I walked up to the tallest and the blondest girl
I said, "Look, you don't know me now
But very soon you will
So won't you let me see
Won't you let me see
Won't you let me see
Your naked body

Just dance me to the dark side of the gym
Chances are I'll let you do most anything
I know you're hungry, I can hear it in your voice
They're many parts of me to touch, you have your choice
But no you cannot see
No you cannot see
No you cannot see
My naked body"

We are dancing close, the band is playing Stardust Balloons
And paper streamers floating down on us
She says, "You've got a minute left to fall in love"
In solemn moments such as this I've put my trust
And all my faith to see
All my faith to see
All my faith to see
Her naked body
