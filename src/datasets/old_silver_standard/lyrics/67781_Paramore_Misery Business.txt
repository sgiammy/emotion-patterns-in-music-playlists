Hit that, hit that snare

I'm in the business of misery; let's take it from the top
She's got a body like an hourglass, it's ticking like a clock
It's a matter of time before we all run out
When I thought he was mine she caught him by the mouth

I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie; he was the only one for me
Two weeks and we had caught on fire
She's got it out for me but I wear the biggest smile

Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now

But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now
And if you could then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

Second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change
Once a whore you're nothing more, I'm sorry, that'll never change
And about forgiveness we're both supposed to have exchanged
I'm sorry, honey, but I passed it up, now look this way

Well, there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right
Well I refuse, I refuse, I refuse

Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now

But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him right now
And if you could then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

I watched his wildest dreams come true
Not one of them involving you
Just watch my wildest dreams come true
Not one of them involving

Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now

Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now

But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now
And if you could then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good
