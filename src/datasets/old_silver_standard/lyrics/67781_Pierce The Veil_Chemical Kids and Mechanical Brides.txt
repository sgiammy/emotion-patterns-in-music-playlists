Like a rush shot through you
Everyone is watching you
Told you why I see no need for the sun
I've found a reason to say
A love you light is a love soon gone
If this is it
Don't bother cause this love is a lie
I'm a chemical kid / You're a mechanical bride
When every vein is red out of the blue
I held a diamond to the sun
To count the moments on account of the way you
Smile for me
Oh, we're in slow motion when you
Smile for me
But oh my God I've been looking
But I still hold your breath so you won't leave
Pastel red and porn star white
Ghost on the altar
We breathe don't leave
Say that the night sings alone

And if there's a God
Then I'm letting Him go
All for you
You alone
Raise my hands
At the thought of you leaving me alone
What if I still care
Don't torture me or beg me
Can you make me believe in tiring
As you fall fast asleep it reminds me
Of the slow symphonies behind me
They sing along
All the nightmares you'll see tomorrow
All the stars on your ceiling they glow
But not for you
Through the trees I'll blow
