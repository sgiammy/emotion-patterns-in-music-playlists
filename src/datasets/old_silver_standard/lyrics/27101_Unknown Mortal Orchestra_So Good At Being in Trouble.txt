Now that you're gone, it's been a long, lonely time
It's a long, sad, lonely time
Rolling along, I'm in a strange state of mind
It's a strange old state of mind
Memories, they mess with my mind, who am I to deny?

She was so good at being in trouble, so good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble, so good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble, so good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble, so bad being in love

Now that you're gone, it's been a long, lonely time
It's a long, sad, lonely time
Rolling along, I'm in a strange state of mind
It's a strange old state of mind
Memories, they mess with my mind, who am I to deny?

She was so good at being in trouble, so good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble, so good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble, so good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble, so bad being in love
