Lupe Fiasco:
Hope the wound heals but it never does
That's 'cause you at war with love
You at war with love, yeah

Guy Sebastian:
These battle scars don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle...

Lupe Fiasco:
Never let a wound ruin me
But I feel like ruins wooing me
Arrow holes that never close from cupid on a shooting spree
Feeling stupid 'cause I know it ain't no you and me

But when you're trying to beat the odds up
Been trying to keep your nods up and you know that you should know
And let her go but the fear of the unknown
Holding another lover strong sends you back into the zone

With no Tom Hanks to bring you home
A lover not a fighter on the frontline with a poem
Trying to write yourself a rifle, maybe sharpen up a song
To fight the tanks and drones of you being alone

Guy Sebastian:
I wish I never looked, I wish I never touched
I wish that I could stop loving you so much
'Cause I'm the only one that's trying to keep us together
When all of the signs say that I should forget her

I wish you weren't the best, the best I ever had
I wish that the good outweighed the bad
'Cause it'll never be over until you tell me it's over

These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change

These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle...

Lupe Fiasco:
(And just leave then)
You shouldn't have but you said it
(And I hope you never come back)
It shouldn't have happened but you let it
Now you're down on the ground screaming "Medic!"
The only thing that comes is the post-traumatic stresses

Shields, body armors and vests
Don't properly work, that's why you're in a locker full of hurt
The enemy within and all the fires from your friends
The best medicine is to probably just let her win

Guy Sebastian:
I wish I couldn't feel, I wish I couldn't love
I wish that I could stop 'cause it hurts so much
And I'm the only one that's trying to keep us together
When all of the signs say that I should forget her

I wish you weren't the best, the best I ever had
I wish that the good outweighed the bad
'Cause it'll never be over until you tell me it's over

These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change

These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle...

'Cause you've set me on fire
I've never felt so alive, yeah

Lupe Fiasco:
Now hope wounds heal but it never does
That's because you at war with love

Guy Sebastian:
And I'm at the point of breaking
And it's impossible to shake it

Lupe Fiasco:
See, you hoped the wound heals but it never does
That's 'cause you at war with love
Hope it heals but it never does
That's 'cause you at war with love

Guy Sebastian:
These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change

These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change

These battle scars, don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
I ain't never gonna change
These battle...
