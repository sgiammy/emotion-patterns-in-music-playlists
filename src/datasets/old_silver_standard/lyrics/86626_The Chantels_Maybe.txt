Maybe, if I pray every night
You'll come back to me
Maybe, if I cry every day
You'll come back to stay
Oh, maybe

Maybe, if I hold your hand
I'll be at your command
And maybe, if I kissed your lips
You'll be at my command
Oh, maybe

I've cried and prayed to the Lord
To send you back my love
But instead you came to me
But only in my dreams

Maybe if I pray every night
You'll come back to me
And maybe if I cry every day
You'll come back to stay
Oh, maybe

(Maybe, maybe, maybe)
Maybe (Maybe, maybe, maybe)
Maybe (Maybe, maybe, maybe)
Maybe (Maybe, maybe, maybe)
