She sits up high, surrounded by the sun
One million branches and she loves everyone
"Mom and dad, did you search for me? 
I've been up here so long I'm going crazy"

And as the sun went down,
We ended up on the ground 
I heard the train shake the windows 
You screamed over the sound 
And as we own this night
I put your body to the test with mine
This love was out of control
3,2,1 - Where did it go?

"Now don't be craziest now, yes of course you can stay here"
(Been in a touring band for going on ten years)
"Big deal," she said, "I guess you're official."
I only said it 'cause I know what it's like to feel - burned out!
It gets you down
We've all been there sometimes
But tonight I'll make you feel beautiful once again.

And as the sun went down 
We ended up on the ground 
I heard the train shake the windows 
You screamed over the sound 
And as we own this night
I put your body to the test with mine
This love was out of control
3,2,1 - Where did it go?

If I were you, I'd put that away
See, you're just wasted and thinking 'bout the past again
Darling, you'll be okay

And she said, 
"If you were me, you'd do the same
'Cause I can't take anymore
I'll draw the shades and close the door
Everything's not alright and I would rather..."

And as the sun went down
We ended up on the ground 
I heard the train shake the windows 
You screamed over the sound 
And as we own this night
I put your body to the test with mine
This love was out of control!
Tell me, where did it go...?
