If you're under the impression I'm alright
I guess you never noticed
I guess you might have known
I've been holding this together for so long
But I guess you might have noticed
Well I guess you...

The beast within the burden is all mine
A product of his father, a slave to his pride
I feel I need to reveal my true stripes
But the bitch of all this trouble here
Waits behind the wind to find out
(Shallow love, shallow love, shallow love, shallow love)

You set me up to leave me, oh you wanted to feel
Shallow love, shallow lives
With every word, you speak of what you wanted from me
Wanted from me, yeah

I'm sinking more and more into my lies
Now home is just a pinprick in the vastness of my life
Feel the pressure, feel the pleasure
Feel the pain, you're not alone
Feel the pleasure, feel the pain 
Feel the pain, hey
(Shallow love, shallow love, shallow love, shallow love)

You set me up to leave me, oh you wanted to feel
Shallow love, shallow lives
With every word, you speak of what you wanted from me
Wanted from me, yeah

Realizations, I am not what you thought I was
You change directions every time someone judges us
In moderation, what was once us now never was
You change directions every time someone judges us

You set me up to leave me, oh you wanted to feel
Shallow love, shallow lives
With every word, you speak of what you wanted from me
You wanted from me, yeah

Set me up to leave me, you set me up to leave me

Realizations, I am not what you thought I was
In moderation, what was once us now never was
