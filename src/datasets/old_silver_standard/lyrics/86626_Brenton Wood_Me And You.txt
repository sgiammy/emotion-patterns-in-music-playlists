Me and You
Let's get away, from it all
Me and You
Having a ball

You know we've been together a long time and you know what we can
Get a lil light weight thing going. If we really put our hearts to it.
If you try and I try girl there's no telling how far we can go.
Remember those lovin' fools Romeo and Juliet they thought they had a
Thing goin' but they just didn't know. THey couldn't visualize they had no
Idea how it could really be but we know

Me and You
Let's get away
Me and You
Having a ball (Oh Yeah)

Yes Lord, we know don't we darlin'.
We won't be wasting our time fustin and fightin like other people
We're gonna be to bust being in love
This is the real thing we found the groove
We move each other, we turn each other on
This could last forever, all we need to do is give some kind of sign yes lord
And from then on baby it's easy lets talk about me and you

Me and You
Let's get away
Me and You
