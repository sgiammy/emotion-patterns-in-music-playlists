I'm gonna' tell you
How much you mean to me
Not now,
Not for a little while
I've got to be make sure
That your love is pure
And you, won't take advantage of me
Capture my heart, and set me free

Someday

When you prove to me
That it's true love that you feel for me
Then I'll, then I'll know
That your love is pure
And I'll be sure
That you, won't take advantage of me
Capture my heart and set me free

Background: Not now
Not now

Not for a little while
I hate to take a chance
And lose a perfect romance

I know you wonder
How long will it be,
Before I tell you
How much you mean to me,
But before I let myself go
I've just gotta' know
If your love dear
Is really real
