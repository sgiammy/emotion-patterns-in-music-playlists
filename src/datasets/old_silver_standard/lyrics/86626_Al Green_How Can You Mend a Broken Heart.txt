I can think of younger days when living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
I was never told about the sorrow

And how can you mend a broken heart
How can you stop the rain from falling down
Tell me, how can you stop the sun from shining
What makes the world go round

And how can you mend this broken man, yeah
How can a loser ever win
Somebody, please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again

I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
But we could never see tomorrow
Would you believe that no one, no one ever told us about the sorrow

So how can you mend a broken heart
Remind me, how can you stop the rain from falling down
Baby, how can you stop that ol' sun from shining
What makes the world go round

And sometimes I have to say, yeah
Say la, la, la...

Tell me, help me mend my, my broken heart
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna
Live again, baby

How can you mend this broken man, yeah
Somebody tell me, how can a loser ever win
Baby, help me mend my, this ol' broken heart
I think I, I know I, I believe I, I feel like I gotta
I feel like I want to live again

How can you mend this broken heart
Somebody please tell me, how can you stop the rain from falling down
Although my clothes are all wet, tell me
How can you mend my, please help me mend my broken heart
I think I, I believe I
I got a feeling that I want to live, live and live
