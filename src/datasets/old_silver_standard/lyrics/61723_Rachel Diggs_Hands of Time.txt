Life is a carousel
Dancing 'round the mirrors we go up and down
So let the music take away the hurt you've come to know so well
Let it go cause...

You can't turn back the hands of time
Just let it go and you'll be fine
What's done is done and its all right
You can't turn back the hands of time

Another day is gone
Washed away with sorrows that you dwelled upon
And as the moon is rising, you think to yourself
I could be gone, if I go now

You can't turn back the hands of time
Just let it go and you'll be fine (whoa)
What's done is done and its all right
You can't turn back the hands of time

You can't turn back the hands of time
Just let it go and you'll be fine (yeah)
What's done is done and its all right
You can't turn back the hands of time (na na na na na)

You can't turn back the hands of time
Just let it go and you'll be fine (yeah)
What's done is done and its all right
You can't turn back the hands of time
