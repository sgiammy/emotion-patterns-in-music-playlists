I believe that your words are fateful
I believe you're the broken one
I believe that your words enable
Now somebody better hide my gun

I believe that your tears are fable
I believe that you stole my sun
I believe that the wounds are fatal
Now you're really gonna have some fun

Let me cross the line now
So I feel alive

Don't let me down again
Praise me, free me
Don't let me down again
You're key to my disaster
Don't let me down again
Blame me, bleed me
Don't let me down again
You're key to my disaster

I concede there were thoughts unfaithful
And I'll concede that my heart is black
You believe that you should be able
To bruise my body and to break my back

You believe that my mind is feeble
And every day I reveal the cracks
And I'm relieved this is finally over
Now I've suffered through my last attack

Let me cross the line now
So I feel alive

So don't let me down again
Praise me, free me
Don't let me down again
You're key to my disaster
Don't let me down again
Blame me, bleed me
Don't let me down again
You're key to my disaster

Let me cross the line now
So I feel alive

Please don't let me down again
Praise me, free me
Don't let me down again
You're key to my disaster
Don't let me down again
Blame me, bleed me
Don't let me down again
You're key to my disaster

You're key to my disaster
