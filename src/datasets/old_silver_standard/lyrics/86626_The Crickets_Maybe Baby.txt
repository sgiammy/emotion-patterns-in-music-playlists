Maybe, baby, I'll have you
Maybe, baby, you'll be true
Maybe, baby, I'll have you for me

It's funny, honey; you don't care
You never listen to my prayer
Maybe, baby, you will love me someday

Well, you are the one that makes me sad
And you are the one that makes me glad
When someday you want me
I'll be there; just wait and see

Maybe, baby, I'll have you
Maybe, baby, you'll be true
Maybe, baby, I'll have you for me

Maybe, baby, I'll have you
Maybe, baby, you'll be true
Maybe, baby, I'll have you for me

It's funny, honey; you don't care
You never listen to my prayer
Maybe, baby, you will love me someday

Well, you are the one that makes me sad
And you are the one that makes me glad
When someday you want me
I'll be there; just wait and see

Maybe, baby, I'll have you
Maybe, baby, you'll be true
Maybe, baby, I'll have you for me

Maybe, baby, I'll have you
Maybe, baby, you'll be true
Maybe, baby, I'll have you for me

Maybe, baby, I'll have you
Maybe, baby, you'll be true
Maybe, baby, I'll have you for me
