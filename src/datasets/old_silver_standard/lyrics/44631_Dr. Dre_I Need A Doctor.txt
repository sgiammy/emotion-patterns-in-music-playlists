Skylar Grey:
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

Eminem:
I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubt's startin' to creep in, every day is just so gray and black

Hope, I just need a ray of that
'Cause no one see's my vision when I play it for 'em, they just say it's whack
But they don't know what dope is, and I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest

You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fightin' you
It's dark, let me turn on the lights and brighten it and enlighten you

I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick you
Gon' either wanna fight, when I get off this fuckin' mic or you
Gon' hug me, but I'm out of options, there's nothin' else I can do, 'cause

Skylar Grey:
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

Eminem:
It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces so I'm puzzled, 'cause the shit I hear is
Crazy, but you're either getting lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form

Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin', and it's almost like your beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure, no more I demand you remember who you are

It was you, who believed in me, when everyone was tellin' you
Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy, Dre I'm cryin' in this booth

You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I could never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith, and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up Dre, I'm dyin' I need you, come back for fuck's sake, 'cause

Skylar Grey:
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

Dr. Dre:
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoked

Went through friends, some of 'em I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death, but where the fuck are they now
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him

Fuckin' backstabbers, when the chips were down, you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets, and ask where the fuck we been
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots

And the crackers' ass, little Cracker Jack beat makin'
Whack, ass-backwards producers, I'm back bastards
One more CD and then I'm packin' up my bags, and as I'm leavin'
I'll guarantee they'll scream "Dre don't leave us like that man," 'cause

Skylar Grey:
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm running out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
