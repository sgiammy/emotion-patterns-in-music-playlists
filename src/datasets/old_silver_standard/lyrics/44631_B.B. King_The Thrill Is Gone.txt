The thrill is gone
The thrill is gone away
The thrill is gone, baby
The thrill is gone away
You know you done me wrong, baby
And you'll be sorry someday

The thrill is gone
It's gone away from me, yeah
The thrill is gone, baby
The thrill is gone away from me
Although I'll still live on
But so lonely I'll be

The thrill is gone
It's gone away for good
Oh, the thrill is gone
Baby, it's gone away for good
Someday I know I'll be over it all, baby
Just like I know a good man should

You know I'm free, free now, baby
I'm free from your spell
Oh, I'm free, free, free now
I'm free from your spell
And now that it's all over
All I can do is wish you well
