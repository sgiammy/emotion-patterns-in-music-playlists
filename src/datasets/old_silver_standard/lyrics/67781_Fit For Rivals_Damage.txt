You don't know anything
You don't know anything
You don't know anything about me

Once it starts, it never stops
Discipline, it's all I'm not
Can't help myself, you listening?
Why can't I say just what I want?

You don't know anything
No, you don't know anything about me

Steady damage, cross the line
What's become clearly defined
Steady damage, cross the line
What's become clearly defined

Chain me up, hold me down
Just let me go, there's always more
I want it all excluding you
Losing control, so construed

Oh, you don't know anything
No, you don't know anything about me

Steady damage, cross the line
What's become clearly defined
Steady damage, cross the line
What's become clearly defined
Steady damage, cross the line
All that is done is left behind
Steady damage, cross the line
You had it all now I've got mine

I can't wait to see your face when I make it without you
Nothing seems to go your way, you'll never amount to

Get away, get away, get away from me
Get away (you'll never amount to)
Get away, get away, get away from me
Get away (you'll never amount to shit)

Steady damage, cross the line
What's become clearly defined
Steady damage, cross the line
What's become clearly defined

Steady damage, cross the line
What's become clearly defined
Steady damage, cross the line
What's become clearly defined
Steady damage, cross the line
All that is done is left behind
Steady damage, cross the line
You had it all now I've got mine

You don't know anything
