Tryna tell me something, I don't listen
I don't pay attention to these children
R-R-R-Runnin' off the highway on a mission
I see green lights, mis-misfits smokin' cannabis
THC bliss, I'm a thug, you a counterfeit
Draped in silk, but I ain't pay shit for this outfit
Saw you in the lobby once, robin jeans, my wings were off
Don't fuck with me, I'm Hulk Hogan
You saw my face, but I'm so dumb

I got stacks, I got lots of stacks on me
Can't leave can't be free, I got stacks
Runnin' up the highway on a mission
I don't pay attention to these children
Runnin' up the highway on a mission
Hunnid stacks on me, VIP, bitch
We roll-
I got stacks, I got lots of stacks on me
Can't leave can't be free, I got stacks
Runnin' up the highway on a mission
I don't pay attention to these children
Runnin' up the highway on a mission
Hunnid stacks on me, VIP, bitch
We roll up!

Yeah I got the knife, I don't wanna use it tonight
Let the stars decide if I'm gonna live or die
Gonna lose my mind, running running through the night
Creeping up outside with my team you know I'm high
Pull up wth no lights, blowing smoke, drinking ice
What's your blood type, what does it taste like?
Riding on my bike, rain this rain is coming down
All my boys can fly, we're like angels in the night

I got stacks, I got lots of stacks on me
Can't leave can't be free, I got stacks
Runnin' up the highway on a mission
I don't pay attention to these children
Runnin' up the highway on a mission
Hunnid stacks on me, VIP, bitch
We roll up!

Louis, gucci, polo, I rock all that shit everyday
Catch me in a four door with yung sherman, hop out in LA
Buildings fallin' down, I need money, I need mine today
You could do all you like, I know I'm stuck up in my ways
I woke up in a gucci linen bed, I'm feelin' fine today
Make it rain, I make it burn, take my chances, take my turn
Runnin' up the highway on a mission, runnin' up the highway on a mission
