I've never gone with the wind
Just let it flow, let it take me
Where it wants to go
'Til you opened the door
There's so much more
I'd never seen it before
I was trying to fly, but I couldn't find wings
Then you came along and you changed everything

You lift my feet off the ground, spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

I watched from a distance as you
Made life your own, every sky was
Your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know
How that would feel and you made it so real
You showed me something that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes and you made me believe

You lift my feet off the ground, spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

Baby, you showed me what living is for
I don't want to hide anymore

You lift my feet off the ground, spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

Crazier, Crazier
