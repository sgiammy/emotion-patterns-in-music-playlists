Yeah this place is wall to wall, can't barely move, takes fifteen minutes just to get a drink
It's crazy here, this crowd tonight's so loud in here you can hardly think
But everything's fading babe, 'cause you're all I see
It's like we're alone in here baby

We might as well be on an island, we might as well be on the moon
The way you're looking at me baby, can't take my eyes off you
Feels like the world is disappearing every time we touch
We're so caught up in each other, it's just the two of us
We might as well be on an island, we might as well be on an island

It's just me and you, back corner booth, we're sitting on the same seat
Got my hands all over you and, yeah girl, you're all over me
Like nobody's watching us baby, let them all see
Still that ain't stopping us baby

We might as well be on an island, we might as well be on the moon
The way you're looking at me baby, can't take my eyes off you
Feels like the world is disappearing every time we touch
We're so caught up in each other, it's just the two of us
We might as well be on an island, we might as well be on an island

We might as well be on an island
Like we're the last two on this Earth
Like we're frozen here in time
Like it's empty here tonight

We might as well be on an island, we might as well be on the moon
The way you're looking at me baby, can't take my eyes off you
Feels like the world is disappearing every time we touch
We're so caught up in each other, it's just the two of us
We might as well be on an island, we might as well be on an island, yeah
