Bruno Mars:
This one's for you and me, livin' out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide, I open my eyes, and now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters, a sky full of lighters

Eminem:
By the time you hear this I will have already spiraled up
I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you, I would duck, or get struck like lightning
Fighters keep fighting, put your lighters up, point em' skyward, uh

Had a dream I was king, I woke up, still king
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking
Till nobody else even fucking feels me, till it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fucking illest in this music

There is or there ever will be, disagree
Feel free, but from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
The only thing I ever gave up's using, no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building

And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped ya life around, crock-o-shit
Who you dicks try to kid, flipped dick, you did the opposite
You stayed the same, 'cause cock backwards is still cock, you pricks

I love it when I tell 'em shove it 'cause it wasn't that
Long ago when Marshall sat, luster lacked, flustered
'Cause he couldn't cut mustard, muster up nothing
Brain fuzzy, 'cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzz, and now you wonder

Why he does it, how he does it, wasn't 'cause he had buzzards circle around his head
Waiting for him to drop dead, was it
Or was it 'cause them bitches wrote him off
Little hussy ass, 'cause fuck, guess it doesn't matter now, does it

What difference it make, what's it take, to get it through your thick skulls
If this ain't, some bullshit people don't usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switch blade to a hater's rib cage

And let it be known from this day forward
I wanna just say thanks 'cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let 'em Bics raise 'cause I came with 5'9" but I feel like I'm 6'8"

Bruno Mars:
This one's for you and me, livin' out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide, I open my eyes, and now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters, a sky full of lighters

Royce da 5'9":
By the time you hear this I'll probably already be outtie
I advance like going from toting iron to going and
Buying 4 or 5 of the homies the iron man Audi
My daddy told me "Slow down, boy, you going to blow it"

And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute
To tell Shady I love him the same way that he did Dr. Dre on The Chronic
Tell him how real he is or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him to know it

I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I right
Till he can march right into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's Lebron's jersey in 20 years

I'll stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up, it's 'bout to be a scary drop
'Cause what goes up must come down
You going down on something you don't wanna see, like a hairy box

Every hour, happy hour now, life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cats meow, ow
Classic cow, always down for the catch weight like Pacquiao

Y'all are doomed, I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself, and autotunes
'Cause now I'm in the Aston, I went from having my city locked up
To getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick

And now I'm fantastic, compared to a weed high
And y'all niggas just gossipin' like bitches on a radio and TV
See me, we fly
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams staring at a beehive

And how real is that
I remember signing my first deal
And now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV Awards gag

Bruno Mars:
You and I know what it's like
To be kicked down, forced to fight
But tonight we're all right
So hold up your lights
Let it shine

'Cause this one's for you and me, livin' out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide, I open my eyes, and now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters, a sky full of lighters
