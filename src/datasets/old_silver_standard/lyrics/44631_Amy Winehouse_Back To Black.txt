He left no time to regret
Kept his dick wet
With his same old safe bet

Me and my head high
And my tears dry
Get on without my guy

You went back to what you knew
So far removed
From all that we went through

And I tread a troubled track
My odds are stacked
I go back to black

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...
I go back to us

I love you much
It's not enough
You love blow and I love puff

And life is like a pipe
And I'm a tiny penny
Rolling up the walls inside

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...

Black, black, black, black
Black, black, black
I go back to
I go back to...

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to...

We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And I go back to black
