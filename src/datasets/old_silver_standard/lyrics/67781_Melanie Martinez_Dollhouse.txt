Hey girl, open the walls, play with your dolls
We'll be a perfect family
When you walk away is when we really play
You don't hear me when I say
"Mom, please wake up, dad's with a slut
And your son is smoking cannabis"
No one ever listens, this wallpaper glistens
Don't let them see what goes down in the kitchen

Places, places, get in your places
Throw on your dress and put on your doll faces
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains
Picture, picture, smile for the picture
Pose with your brother, won't you be a good sister?
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains

D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E
I see things that nobody else sees
D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E
I see things that nobody else sees

Hey girl, look at my mom, she's got it going on
Ha, you're blinded by her jewelry
When you turn your back, she pulls out a flask
And forgets his infidelity
Uh-oh, she's coming to the attic
Plastic, go back to being plastic
No one ever listens, this wallpaper glistens
One day they'll see what goes down in the kitchen

Places, places, get in your places
Throw on your dress and put on your doll faces
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains
Picture, picture, smile for the picture
Pose with your brother, won't you be a good sister?
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains

D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E
I see things that nobody else sees
D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E
I see things that nobody else sees

Hey girl

Hey girl, open your walls, play with your dolls
We'll be a perfect family

Places, places, get in your places
Throw on your dress and put on your doll faces
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains
Picture, picture, smile for the picture
Pose with your brother, won't you be a good sister?
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains

D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E
