People say I'm the life of the party
'Cause I tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue

So, take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you, need you

Since you left me if you see me with another girl
Seeming like I'm having fun
Although she may be cute
She's just a substitute, because
You're the permanent one

So, take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
Yeah, look a little bit closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you, need you

Outside I'm masquerading
Inside my hope is fading
Just a clown oh yeah
Since you put me down
My smile is my make up
I wear since my break up with you

Baby, take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
Yeah just look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears, baby, baby, baby, baby

Take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
Oh look a little bit closer, it's easy to trace
Yeah, the tracks of my tears
Oh yeah, baby take a good look
