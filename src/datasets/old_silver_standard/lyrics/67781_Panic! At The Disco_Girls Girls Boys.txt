I don't wanna hear you've got a boyfriend
Sometimes you're better off alone
But if you change your mind, you know where I am
Yeah, if you change your mind, you know where to find me
'Cause I don't ever wanna be your boyfriend

And never did I think that I
Would be caught in the way you got me
Push another girl aside and just give in

Girls love girls and boys
Girls love girls and boys
And never did I think that I
Would be caught in the way you got me
But girls love girls and boys
And love is not a choice

Pose, you've gotta save your reputation
They're close to finding out about your girlfriend
But if you change your mind, you know where I am
Yeah, if you change your mind, you know where to find me
'Cause I don't wanna save your reputation

And never did I think that I
Would be caught in the way you got me
Push another girl aside and just give in

Girls love girls and boys
Girls love girls and boys
And never did I think that I
Would be caught in the way you got me
But girls love girls and boys
And love is not a choice

I am just a villain vying for attention from a girl
A girl who can't decide and here's the reason why

Girls love girls and boys
Girls love girls and boys 
Girls love girls and boys 
Girls love girls and boys

And never did I think that I
Would be caught in the way you got me
But girls love girls and boys
And love is not a choice
