Help, I have done it again
I have been here many times before
Hurt myself again today
And the worst part is there's no one else to blame

Be my friend
Hold me
Wrap me up, unfold me
I am small
I'm needy
Warm me up
And breathe me

Ouch, I have lost myself again
Lost myself and I am nowhere to be found
Yeah, I think that I might break
Lost myself again and I feel unsafe

Be my friend
Hold me
Wrap me up, unfold me
I am small
I'm needy
Warm me up
And breathe me

Be my friend
Hold me
Wrap me up, unfold me
I am small
I'm needy
Warm me up
And breathe me
