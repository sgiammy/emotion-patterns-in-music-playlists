The key and the gate it's a leanworld
Heavenly Kingdom with a lean girl
The key and the gate it's a leanworld
Heavenly Kingdom with a lean girl
I see her

I see her
At the back of the club with my boys blowing dub
We don't talk, don't show love, white shoes, white gloves
Dark night, end of
You got dro? lots of
In the sky, like a dove I wanna die and reach above
I never lie, as I seek of the one who walked out of my life, I can't get a hold of
SBE is who you speak of, I wanna be the one who you speak of, the one who you dream of
Lay me down, concrete love
Lay me down, concrete love

Thinking bout what once was and how I should have done it better smoking drugs till I'm reckless
Now I'm wrecked and you miss me like I reckon
Snow White coke imma die as a legend
Never felt threatened, we used to be peasants
Me and my boys blowing up like nuclear weapons
Spray painted heaven
My shit together the whole world infected
Only the fans get it, I see my reflection get my money, then I check in
You're blessed by my presence, I just died and I checked in to heaven
To heaven

The key and the gate, it's a Leanworld
Heavenly kingdom with a lean girl
I see her
The key and the gate, it's a Leanworld
Heavenly kingdom with a lean girl
Lay me down, concrete love
Lay me down, concrete love
Lay me down, lay me down
The key and the gate, it's a Leanworld
Heavenly kingdom with a lean girl
I see her, I see her
