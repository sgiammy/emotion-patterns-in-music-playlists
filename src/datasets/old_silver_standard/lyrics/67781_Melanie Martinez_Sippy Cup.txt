Blood still stains when the sheets are washed
Sex don't sleep when the lights are off
Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
And syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup

He's still dead when you're done with the bottle
Of course it's a corpse that you keep in the cradle
Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
Syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup

Blood, money, blood, money
How do you afford this ring that I love, honey?
Just another shift at the drug company
He doesn't think I'm that fucking dumb, does he?

It doesn't matter what, you pull up to your home
We know what goes on inside
You call that ass your own, we call that silicone
Silly girl with silly boys

Blood still stains when the sheets are washed
Sex don't sleep when the lights are off
Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
And syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup

He's still dead when you're done with the bottle
Of course it's a corpse that you keep in the cradle
Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
Syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup

Sippy cup, s-s-sippy cup
In a sippy cup, sippy cup
In a sippy cup, in a sippy cup
In a sippy cup, in a sippy cup

Pill diet, pill diet
If they give you a new pill, then you will buy it
If they say to kill yourself, then you will try it
All the makeup in the world won't make you less insecure

You got weights in your pockets
When you go to the doctor's
Your favorite candy's cotton
That's why all your teeth are rotten
Silly girl with silly boys

Blood still stains when the sheets are washed
Sex don't sleep when the lights are off
Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
And syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup

He's still dead when you're done with the bottle
Of course it's a corpse that you keep in the cradle
Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
Syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup

Sippy cup, s-s-sippy cup
In a sippy cup, sippy cup
In a sippy cup, in a sippy cup
In a sippy cup, in a sippy cup

Blood still stains when the sheets are washed
Sex don't sleep when the lights are off
Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
And syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup
