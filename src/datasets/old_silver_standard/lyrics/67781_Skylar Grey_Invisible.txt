I take these pills 
To make me thin
I dye my hair
And cut my skin
I try everything
To make them see me
But all they see
Is someone that's not me

Even when I'm walking on a wire
Even when I set myself on fire
Why do I always feel invisible, invisible?
Every day I try to look my best
Even though inside I'm such a mess
Why do I always feel invisible, invisible?

Here inside
My quiet heart
You cannot hear
My cries for help
I try everything
To make them see me
But everyone
Sees what I can't be

Even when I'm walking on a wire
Even when I set myself on fire
Why do I always feel invisible, invisible?
Every day I try to look my best
Even though inside I'm such a mess
Why do I always feel invisible, invisible?

Sometimes when I'm alone
I pretend that I'm a queen
It's almost believable

Even when I'm walking on a wire
Even when I set myself on fire
Why do I always feel invisible, invisible?
Every day I try to look my best
Even though inside I'm such a mess
Why do I always feel invisible, invisible?
