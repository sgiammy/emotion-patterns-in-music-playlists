I'm in trouble
I'm an addict
I'm addicted to this girl
She's got my heart tied in a knot
And my stomach in a whirl

But even worse
I can't stop calling her
She's all I want and more
I mean damn
What's not to adore?

I've been playing too much guitar
I, I've been listening to jazz
I called so many times
I swear she's going mad
And that cellular will be the death of us
I swear, I swear

And oh
O-oh, o-oh, o-ooh
Ooh

I'm running my mouth
Just like I got her
But I surely don't

Because she's so
O-oh, o-oh, o-ooh
Rock 'n' roll
And out of my league
Is she out of my league?
Let's hope not

I'm in trouble
I'm so cliche'
See that word just wears me out
Makes me feel like just another boy
To laugh and joke about

But even worse
I can't stop calling her
I love to hear that voice
And honestly
I'm left with no choice

I've been playing too much guitar
I, I've been listening to jazz
I called so many times
I swear she's going mad
And that cellular will be the death of us
I swear, I swear

And oh
O-oh, o-oh, o-ooh
Ooh

I'm running my mouth
Just like I got her
But I surely don't

Because she's so
O-oh, o-oh, o-ooh
Rock 'n' roll
And out of my league
Is she out of my league?
Let's hope not

And oh
O-oh, o-oh, o-ooh
Ooh, ooh
