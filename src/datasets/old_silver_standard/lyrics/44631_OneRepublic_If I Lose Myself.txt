I stared up at the sun
Thought of all the people, places and things I've loved
I stared up just to see
Of all the faces,
You are the one next to me

You can feel the light start to tremble
Washing what you know out to sea
You can see your life out of the window, tonight

If I lose myself tonight
It'll be by your side
If I lose myself tonight
Whoo, whoo, whoo

If I lose myself tonight
It'll be you and I
Lose myself tonight
Whoo

I woke up with the sun
Thought of all the people, places and things I've loved
I woke up just to see
Of all the faces
You are the one next to me

You can feel the light start to tremble
Watching what you know out to see

You can see your life out of the window, tonight

If I lose myself tonight
It'll be by your side
If I lose myself tonight
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

If I lose myself tonight
It'll be you and I
Lose myself tonight
Whooooooo

Take us down, and we keep trying
Forty-thousand feet, keep flying
Take us down, and we keep trying
Forty-thousand feet, keep flying
Take us down, and we keep trying
Forty-thousand feet, keep flying
Take us down, and we keep trying
Forty-thousand feet, keep flying
Take us down, and we keep trying
Forty-thousand feet, keep flying
Lose myself
If I lose myself tonight
Whoo
Whoo, whoo
Whoo
