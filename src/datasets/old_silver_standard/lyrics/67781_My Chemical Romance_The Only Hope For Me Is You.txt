Remember me
Remember me
Remember me
Remember me

When, where will you stand
When all the lights go out across these city streets
Where were you when all of the embers fell, I still remember them
Covered in ash, covered in glass
Covered in all my friends, I still think of the bombs they built

If there's a place that I could be then I'd be another memory
Can I be the only hope for you, because you're the only hope for me
And if we can find where we belong we'll have to make it on our own
Face all the pain and take it on, because the only hope for me is you alone

How would you be many years after the disasters that we've seen
What have we learned other then people burn in purifying flame
I say it's okay, I know you can tell, though you can see me smile I still
Think of the guns they sell

If there's a place that I could be then I'd be another memory
Can I be the only hope for you, because you're the only hope for me
And if we can find where we belong, we'll have to make it on our own
Face all the pain and take it on, because the only hope for me is you alone

The only hope for me
The only hope for me is you
The only hope for me is you
The only hope for me is you
The only hope for me is you
The only hope

If there's a place that I could be then I'd be another memory
Can I be the only hope for you, because you're the only hope for me
And if we can find where we belong, we'll have to make it on our own
Face all the pain and take it on, because the only hope for me is you alone

The only hope for me is you
The only hope for me is you
The only hope for me is you
The only hope for me is you
The only hope for me is you
The only hope for me is you
The only hope for me is you
The only hope for me is you
The only hope for me is you
