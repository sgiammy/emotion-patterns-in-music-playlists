    "One thing which is very impressive from the above analysis in when \"man\" is recognized to be an interjection. An interjection is a part of speech that shows the emotion or feeling of the author. These words or phrases can stand alone or be placed before or after a sentence. Many times an interjection is followed by a punctuation mark, often an exclamation point ([reference](http://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-interjections.html)). This description perfectly fits with the usage of the word \"man\" in this context. However this one was not trivial to detect. This POS tagger feature is quite impressive and it is certainly very useful because songs tends to use those things quite often.\n",
