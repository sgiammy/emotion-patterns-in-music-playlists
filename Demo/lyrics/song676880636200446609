I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas please
Fold 'em, let 'em hit me, raise it, baby stay with me (I love it)
LoveGame intuition, play the cards with spades to start
And after he's been hooked I'll play the one that's on his heart

I'll get him hard, show him what I got
I'll get him hard, show him what I got

Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)

Puh-puh-puh-poker face
Fuh-fuh-fuck her face
Puh-puh-puh-poker face
Fuh-fuh-fuck her face

I wanna roll with him, a hard pair we will be
A little gambling is fun when you're with me (I love it)
Russian roulette is not the same without a gun
And baby when it's love if it's not rough it isn't fun (fun)

I'll get him hard, show him what I got
I'll get him hard, show him what I got

Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)

Puh-puh-puh-poker face
Fuh-fuh-fuck her face
Puh-puh-puh-poker face
Fuh-fuh-fuck her face

I won't tell you that I love you kiss or hug you
'Cause I'm bluffin' with my muffin
I'm not lyin'
I'm just stunnin' with my love glue-gunnin'

Just like a chick in the casino
Take your bank before I pay you out
I promise this, promise this
Check this hand 'cause I'm marvelous

Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)

Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)

Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)

Puh-puh-puh-poker face
Fuh-fuh-fuck her face
Puh-puh-puh-poker face
Fuh-fuh-fuck her face
(She's got me like nobody)
Puh-puh-puh-poker face
Fuh-fuh-fuck her face
Puh-puh-puh-poker face
Fuh-fuh-fuck her face
Puh-puh-puh-poker face
Fuh-fuh-fuck her face
Puh-puh-puh-poker face
Fuh-fuh-fuck her face
