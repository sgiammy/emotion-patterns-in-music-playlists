Oh, now
Oh!

Just shoot for the stars
If it feels right
Then aim for my heart

If you feel like it
Take me away
And make it okay
I swear I'll behave

You wanted control
So we waited
I put on a show

Now I'm naked
You say I'm a kid
My ego is big
I don't give a shit

And it goes like this
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you

All the moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger

I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you

With them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger

Maybe it's hard
When you feel like
You're broken and scarred
Nothing feels right

But when you're with me
I'll make you believe
That Iâ€™ve got the key

Oh, so get in the car
You can ride it
Wherever you want
Get inside it

And you wanna steer
But I'm shifting gears
I'll take it from here

Oh yeah, yeah
And it goes like this
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you

All the moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger, woo

I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you

With them moves like Jagger 
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger

Uh, you wanna know
How to make me smile
Take control
Own me just for the night

Well, if I share my secret
You're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this, eh, uh

So watch and learn
I won't show you twice
Head to toe
Ooh, baby, rub me right, yeah

But if I share my secret
You're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this
Hey, hey, hey, yeah

And it goes like this
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you
Kiss me till you're drunk and I'll show you

All the moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger, woo!

I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you

With them moves like Jagger 
I've got them moves like Jagger
I've got them moves like Jagger
