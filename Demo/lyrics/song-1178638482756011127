Cold, 'cause she has been here before
She doesn't cry anymore, no looking back
No, she doesn't go to the bar
Too many lovers she's scarred, and they want her back

She loves control, she wants it her way
And there's no way she'll ever stay unless you give it up (give it up)
She loves control, she wants it her way
And all it takes is just one taste, you wanna give it up (give it up)

Bold, you know she lives for the thrill
You know she lusts for the kill, so they won't come back
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Don't, don't you try taming the storm
Don't say you haven't been warned (ooh!)
'Cause she won't like that, like that

She loves control, she wants it her way
And there's no way she'll ever stay unless you give it up
She loves control, she wants it her way
And all it takes is just one taste, you wanna give it up (give it up, give it up for love)

She loves control (control, hey)
She loves control (control, hey)

Say what you want
But the way she kills you makes you feel alive
And you know that it feels right

She loves control, she wants it her way
And there's no way she'll ever stay unless you give it up
She loves control, she wants it her way
And all it takes is just one taste, you wanna give it up

She loves control (control, hey)
She loves, she loves
She loves, she loves
She loves control (control, hey)
