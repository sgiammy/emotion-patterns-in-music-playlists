Mmm, yeah
No, no, yeah
Been lookin' for you in all the wrong places
But I don't go there no more
Every night seein' all the same faces
But I ain't seen you before

I don't even know you, know you, know you
But girl, I think I love you, love you, love you
I put my lifeline in your hands
(Lifeline in your hands)
I already know it's over, over
Never fightin' you again, no sir
What I got to lose, I will take a chance

Girl I'm not afraid in runnin' away tonight though
I put my heart on the line for you, I put my heart on the line for you
All my friends think I'm crazy, maybe I've lost my mind, but
I put my heart on the line for you, my heart on the line for

You
I put my heart on the line for you, I put my heart on the line for you
For you
I put my heart on the line for you, my heart on the line for

Didn't come in lookin' for a situation
But who woulda thought?
I'd be breakin' every rule I ever made, but
Guess it's a good time to start

I don't even know you, know you, know you
But girl, I think I love you, love you, love you
I put my lifeline in your hands
(Lifeline in your hands)
I already know it's over, over
Never fightin' you again, no sir
What I got to lose, I will take a chance

Girl I'm not afraid in runnin' away tonight though
I put my heart on the line for you, I put my heart on the line for you
All my friends think I'm crazy, maybe I've lost my mind, but
I put my heart on the line for you, my heart on the line for

You
I put my heart on the line for you, I put my heart on the line for you
For you
I put my heart on the line for you, my heart on the line for

Girl, your body's callin'
Girl, I'm goin' all in
I put my heart on the line for you, I put my heart on the line for you
And all the stars allignin'
Just like perfect timin'
I put my heart on the line for you, my heart on the line for

You, oh no
I put my heart on the line for you, I put my heart on the line for you
For you
I put my heart on the line for you, my heart on the line for
