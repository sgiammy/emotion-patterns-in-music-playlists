Can't help but wondering if this
Is the last time that I'll see your face
Is it tears or just the fucking rain?
Wish I could say something
Something that doesn't sound insane
But lately, I don't trust my brain
You tell me I won't ever change
So I just say nothing

No matter where I go
I'm always gonna want you back
No matter how long you're gone
I'm always gonna want you back
I know you know
I will never get over you
No matter where I go
I'm always gonna want you back
Want you back

I remember the freckles on your back
And the way that I used to make you laugh
'Cause you know every morning I wake up
Yeah, I still reach for you
I remember the roses on your shirt
When you told me this would never work
You know, even when I say I moved on
Yeah, I still dream for you

And no matter where I go
I'm always gonna want you back
No matter how long you're gone
I'm always gonna want you back
I know you know
I will never get over you
No matter where I go
I'm always gonna want you back
Want you back

You know even when I say I moved on
You know even though I know that you're gone
All I think about is where I went wrong
You know even when I say I moved on
You know even though I know that you're gone
All I think about is where I went wrong
Yeah I still dream for you
No matter where I go I'm always gonna want you back

No matter where I go
I'm always gonna want you back (I'm always gonna want you back)
No matter how long you're gone
I'm always gonna want you back
I know you know
I will never get over you
No matter where I go
I'm always gonna want you back
Want you back

Always gonna want you back
Want you back
Always gonna want you back
Want you back
