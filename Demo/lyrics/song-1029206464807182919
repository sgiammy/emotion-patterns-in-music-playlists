One foot in front of the other, babe
One breath leads to another, yeah
Just keep moving
Look within for the strength today
Listen now for the voice to say
Just keep moving

Go, go, go, figure it out
Figure it out, but don't stop moving
Go, go, go, figure it out
Figure it out, you can do this

So my love, keep on running
You gotta get through today
There my love, keep on running
Gotta keep those tears at bay
Oh my love, don't stop burning
Gotta send them up in flames
In flames

Don't stop, tomorrow's another day
Don't stop, tomorrow you'll feel no pain
Just keep moving
Don't stop, the past will trip you up
You know, right now's never be enough
Just keep moving

Go, go, go, figure it out
Figure it out, but don't stop moving
Go, go, go, figure it out
Figure it out, you can do this

So my love, keep on running
You gotta get through today
There my love, keep on running
Gotta keep those tears at bay
Oh my love, don't stop burning
Gotta send them up in flames
In flames
In flames
In flames

Go, go, go, figure it out
Figure it out, but don't stop moving
Go, go, go, figure it out
Figure it out, you can do this

So my love, keep on running
You gotta get through today
There my love, keep on running
Gotta keep those tears at bay
Oh my love, don't stop burning
Gotta send them up in flames
In flames
