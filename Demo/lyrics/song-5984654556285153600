I gotta feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

I gotta feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

I gotta feeling, ooohooo
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

I gotta feeling, ooohooo
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night, I gotta feel

Tonight's the night, let's live it up
I got my money, let's spend it up
Go out and smash it like, oh my god
Jump off that sofa, let's get, get off

I know that we'll have a ball
If we get down and go out and just lose it all
I feel stressed out, I wanna let it go
Let's go way out, spaced out and losing all control (ch-ch-ch)

Fill up my cup, mazel tov
Look at her dancing, just take it off
Let's paint the town, we'll shut it down
Let's burn the roof and then we'll do it again

Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, let's do it
And do it and do it, let's live it up
And do it and do it and do it, do it, do it
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it

'Cause I gotta feeling, ooohoo
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

'Cause I gotta feeling, ooohoo
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night, I gotta feel

Tonight's the night (Hey!), let's live it up (Let's live it up)

Here we come, here we go, we gotta rock (Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock)
Easy come, easy go, now we on top (Top, top, top, top, top)
Feel the shot, body rock, rock it, don't stop (Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop)
'Round and 'round, up and down, around the clock (Clock, clock, clock, clock, clock)

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday (Let's do it!)
Friday, Saturday, Saturday to Sunday (Do it!)
Get, get, get, get, get with us, you know what we say, say
Party every day, p-p-p-party every day
