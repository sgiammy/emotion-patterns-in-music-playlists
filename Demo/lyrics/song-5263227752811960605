I ain't gone be cooking all day
I ain't your mama
I ain't gonna do your laundry
I ain't your mama

Boy, I ain't your mama
When you gone get your act together
I ain't your mama

No, I ain't your mama no
No, I ain't your mama no

Wake up, rise and shine (oh yeah yeah yeah)
Best get to work on time (oh yeah yeah yeah)
No more playing video games (oh yeah yeah yeah)
'Cause things are about to change, round here round here

We used to be, crazy in love
Can't we go back, to how it was?
When did you get, too comfortable?
'Cause I'm to good for that, I'm too good for that 
Just remember that, Hey!

Boy, I ain't your mama
When you gone get your act together
I ain't your mama

No, I ain't your mama no
No, I ain't your mama no

You're lucky to have these curves (oh yeah yeah yeah)
Stop getting on my nerves (oh yeah yeah yeah)
You still tryna ride this train (oh yeah yeah yeah)
'Cause some things have gotta change, round here round here

We used to be, crazy in love
Can't we go back, to how it was?
When did you get, too comfortable?
