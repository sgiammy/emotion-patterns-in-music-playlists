Yeah, high off life, low on sleep
Down on luck, I've been up all week
Maybe there could be somebody that saves me?

I been faded quite lately
It's no fun when you're alone
Now I gotta call a taxi
My car broke down, dead battery
I've been blocked off my Uber
The drivers a dickhead if you ask me
'Cause I was smellin' like an ounce
Like a zapp, watching summertime bounce
I came here to get lifted, I'll be surfing clouds

That's when I, I first saw you
Looking like a Friday night out
I wanna take you to the crib
And cut all the lights out
'Cause I need your company
And I want it right now, right now

Baby, I'mma need another hit
'Cause I want your love
Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale
Baby, I'mma need another hit
'Cause I want your love
Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, oh yeah

Can you roll?
If so then I can get it for the low
What you need?
Trust me, everything is better with the green
Don't kill my vibe, don't blow my buzz
'Cause I'm a fiend
MÃ©nage trois, let's make it three
Selfish, I need you for me
You'll be like my medication
Doctor seems to be the only one with patience
Don't need a cure for these sympoms
I just need some assistance
I came here to get lifted up

That's when I, I first saw you
Looking like a Friday night out
I wanna take you to the crib
And cut all the lights out
'Cause I need your company
And I want it right now, right now

Baby, I'mma need another hit
'Cause I want your love
Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale
Baby, I'mma need another hit
'Cause I want your love
Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, oh yeah

Let me love you
There's no better way to spend the day
Than getting high with me
Yeah, so let me love you
There's no better way to end a day
Than getting high with me

Baby, I'mma need another hit
'Cause I want your love
Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale
Baby, I'mma need another hit
'Cause I want your love
Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, oh yeah
'Cause I want your love
Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale
'Cause I want your love
Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, oh yeah
