Heh?
Guwop

I see you treat me differently
'Cause you don't need therapy on a Friday night
And you said you'd be there for me, I can't believe
I should have known you wouldn't at the time, no no
Promise me you'll never change
But can't explain why you never come around no more
So this is how it's gonna be?
You're texting me on my birthday
You don't even try

Remember, you told me you'd never forget where you came from
Remember, you told me we'd always stay homies from day one

And now you're not who you used to be
I don't know what you're tryna prove
So hit me up when you're over being cool
Your new friends will say anything
But if you wanna know the truth
Hit me up when you're over being cool

Cool
Cool

Used to ask me for my help
When no one else gave a fuck about a single word you said
In a minute I'll be there, no matter where
Kinda funny just how quickly you forget

Remember, you told me you'd never forget where you came from
Remember, you told me we'd always stay homies from day one

And now you're not who you used to be
I don't know what you're tryin' prove
So hit me up when you're over being cool
Your new friends will say anything
But if you wanna know the truth
Hit me up when you're over being cool

Uh, yeah, go
I got her sprung for my dick, she addicted (yeah)
I got a rude girl, rich off her lipstick (mwah)
Designer diva, we both materialistic (Guc)
I'm from the 6, but I ball like the fifth pick (ball)
To make her slide through, I gotta tell her some slick
So many diamonds in it, [?] her wrist band
I thought your homegirl was cool, but she flipped it (no)
Don't listen to them hoes, man that's gossip (oh)
Skinny chick only point me to a thick bitch (yeah)
Ugly bitch only point me to a pretty chick (yeah)
We ain't turning down, not even a little bit (no)
But if they can't read between the lines, they illiterate
It's Gucci

Remember, you told me you'd never forget where you came from
Remember, you told me we'd always stay homies from day one

Cool
And now you're not who you used to be
I don't know what you're tryna prove
So hit me up when you're over being cool
Your new friends will say anything
But if you wanna know the truth
Hit me up when you're over being cool
